## Introduction

This article assumes that you have read the first. If you have not done so already, please do. Otherwise, let's dive right in.

## Kamala - Exploring Sensuality

### Being Present

Siddhartha had been reborn and sees the world in a different light. Now he had become truly "present" in this world and was starting to mind things that he once would have glossed over while focusing on something which was not present. Speaking regarding the details of nature and the world around him, Hesse writes regarding Siddhartha,

> But now his unfettered vision dwelt here- he saw and acknowledged the visible, sought his home in this world. He no longer pursued the essence or looked toward the beyond. The world was beautiful when one just looked at it without looking for anything, just simply, as a child... All of this had always been there, and he had not seen it. He had not been there with it (pgs. 49-50).

Being "present" is an important skill for high-focus tasks but also key for enjoying activities such as traveling. Often times, it is stress or unnecessary thoughts that keep us from being "present". The ability to become "present" on demand also means that one can redirect these thoughts and put them off until a time that something can be done about those concerns.

Siddhartha also adopted a stance of "childlike wonder", seeing the world as if for the first time and not demanding anything from it. He simply saw things and enjoyed seeing them.

### Becoming a Sensate - Chasing Beauty

Siddhartha quickly realized that the beauty around him was not limited to passive observation. Seeing was one thing, but there were so many other senses that he was denying from experiencing beauty. On his path, Siddhartha found a river and was struck by its beauty. He encountered a ferryman that offered to take him across the river for free. When thanked for his hospitality, the ferryman comments that he expects Siddhartha will return to cross the river again one day.

The river appears to be a metaphor for crossing into a life as a sensate. It represents a stage in life when person is free from the children's creche of their spiritual development and begins to see the world with "open eyes". It feels analogous to a college student leaving the house to experience the world for the first time and it reminds me of the "Grand Tours" of Europe taken by the upper classes as part of a "classical education".

### The City - Finding your Way in the World

After a long journey, Siddhartha reached the city. Very soon after his entrance to the city, he witnessed a procession entering a pleasure garden. The procession centered around a woman of extreme beauty by the name of Kamala. Siddhartha is enraptured by Kamala and quickly seeks to gain her favor so that he may experience romance with her, something that he had denied himself throughout his entire life.

In this section, Hesse once again seems to be using a *maximal case*. In past sections, we saw Siddhartha be the best he could be at organized religion, experience the fullest extent of asceticism, and interact with somebody who had achieved enlightenment. Because the "maximal cases" of these different paths did not bring him any closer to his goal of enlightenment, he was able to rule those paths out and pursue different ones. I suspect that Kamala represents the "epitome" of beauty and we are left to see whether partaking in that beauty will directly cause Siddhartha to achieve enlightenment.

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Kamala" content="
This name in Sanskrit means *lotus-flower* or a *sacred lotus*. As an adjective it can be used to refer to someone as *lustful* or *libidinous*."

Siddhartha makes his romantic intentions clear to Kamala. His poetry attracts him, but Kamala laments that their stations in life are simply too different. Siddhartha must achieve material wealth and social stature if he is to engage Kamala romantically, but the skills that he developed while pursuing his former paths appear remarkably worthless- all but one. He could think and he could think very well. Furthermore, he was capable of focusing his will with extreme intensity, meaning that once Siddhartha identified a goal, he could pursue it with extreme efficiency. Kamala gave Siddhartha a kiss as a parting gift along with a recommendation to an open staff position with one of the city's top merchants.

### Reaction

It is very interesting that although Siddhartha seems to have found what he believes to be the correct path towards enlightenment, he does not appear to experience any sense of frustration or loss at having "wasted" so much time in life pursuing dead ends.

Another common issue with the pursuit of beauty is that experiencing beauty often comes with a price tag. It is expensive to travel to the world's most beautiful places. It costs a lot of money to eat fine foods and drink fine drinks. Attending art galleries is expensive. Beautiful people understand the value of their relationships and tend to seek to engage with those of sufficient financial standing. Siddhartha hit the financial firewall around beauty very quickly, yet he did not dismay. He identified a path to success, created and leveraged a connection, and then set to meet his financial goals as quickly as possible.

It is unfortunate that a certain level of financial standing and stability is required to pursue certain paths in life, but achieving this financial security can be considered as another part of the spiritual "children's creche". Common rites of passages for middle class westerners are to achieve a profession, marry a spouse, and purchase property. After securing financial freedom, companionship, and a home, the individual is free to pursue their passions. I wonder if the pursuit of these passions are often mis-identified as "mid-life crises".

## Among the Child People

In this chapter, Siddhartha pursues a professional career. As mentioned in the last chapter, careers are important as they often provide what is necessary to pursue your paths in life. Although it is unlikely that a professional career in itself will allow someone to reach nirvana, it is considered a "must-have" by most. A lot of the content of this chapter is great advice for a young professional.

### The Importance of Discipline and Patience in the Professional World

With the help of Kamala's recommendation, Siddhartha began his professional career as a merchant. At first, the merchant Kamaswami was hesitant to hire on Siddhartha because his only profession of skill was, "I can think, I can wait, I can fast" (pg. 68). Although at first glance fasting seems useless, the key skills behind fasting are patience and restraint. People who exercise patience and restraint are able to endure periods of hardship or derth in order to achieve greater rewards at a later time. Discipline is in general seen as a desirable trait in the professional world as it often translates to level-headed decision making, self-improvement, and willingness to take the best kind of risks, those which are carefully calculated.

Interestingly, Siddhartha had skills which were relevant to being a merchant, such as reading and writing. However, he did not seem to view these as skills worth noting, hinting at a concept that will be touched upon later in this chapter. We are left with this saying to wet our appetites for an important concept:

> Writing is good, thinking is better. Cleverness is good, patience is better (pg. 69)

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Kamaswami" content="
The word *swami* may seem familiar to you, as its meaning of *master* is somewhat common knowledge in the west. *Kama* refers to erotic love and *kamasu* can refer to fulfilling the desires and gratifying wishes. So *Kamaswami* appears to rough translates to a *master of erotic desires*. Just as Kamala represents the ultimate object of erotic desire, so does Kamaswami represent the ultimate obtainer of these desires."

### Avoiding Deep Attachments to Careers - Smelling the Roses

Siddhartha's career started off well. He won some deals, he lost some deals, and used the earnings from his career to begin his romantic relationship with the courtesan Kamala. Kamaswami notes:

> He was quick to see that Siddhartha understood little about rice and wool, ships' voyages and business dealing, but that he had a lucky touch, and that Siddhartha exceeded his own ability or calmness and equanimity, in the art of listening, and in the seeing into the hearts of strangers... He always gives the impression of merely toying with business dealings. He never gets truly involved in them, they never dominate his mind; he never fears failure, is never bothered by loss. (pg. 71)

Although he was not raised in the world of business and still did not seem to be catching on to the fine details (or "specializing" in his trade), Siddhartha's mindset enabled him to be successful nonetheless. Further descriptions in the chapter depict Siddhartha's seemingly nonchalant approach to the successes and failures of his career. This may seem off-putting to some some, as it did to Kamaswami. However, a professional career, indeed life itself, is rollercoaster of inevitable ups and downs. Although we are often times forced to ride these ups and downs, we do not have to choose to take part in them emotionally. By detaching ourselves from the ups and downs emotionally (think of the *witness conscious* from the first part of the novel), we can obtain the same sense of level-headedness that Siddhartha had and become disciplined in our actions.

At this point it is good to remember that this novel deals very much so with ideal cases. "Having no fear of failure" may work in this novel's world but we need to keep a healthy respect of the fact that failure is a part of life, is sometimes entirely out of our control, and needs to be recognized and accepted as a possibility. However, it appears that Siddhartha's lack of fear from failure comes from him knowing that his skill set, "thinking, waiting, and fasting" will enable him to easily endure and quickly rebound from failure. This again teases at a what I feel is a central concept of this chapter.

### Smelling the Roses - Even at Work

At one point Siddhartha travels to a village and quickly realizes that there the business opportunity which was once present was there no longer. Instead of cutting losses and returning home, as many business people would do, he instead stayed in the village for several days to enjoy his time, attend social events, and build relationships. Kamaswami confronted Siddhartha about this apparent misuse of time and funds (it is worth noting at this point that Siddhartha had been given a third of the business and he was fully responsible for its earnings and losses, so this affront was not as grievous as it would be if the money he was spending were not "his"). Although Kamaswami's stance was both confrontational and accusatory, Siddhartha remains emotionally attached in his response, albeit with a touch of superiority,

> "Definitely," laughed Siddhartha, "I definitely took that trip for pleasure. Why else? I got to know people and places, I enjoyed hospitality and trust, I found friendship. You see, my friend, if I had been Kamaswami, as soon as I saw that my business deal was foiled, I would have turned around instantly and come back home totally upset. The time and money would have in fact been lost. But in my case I had a few good days, learned things, had a good time, and harmed neither myself nor anyone else through anger in haste. And if I ever go back there... I will be warmly and kindly received by friendly people... (pg. 73)

If Siddhartha had been riding the rollercoaster of a deep emotional attachment with his career, the loss of the deal would have soured his mood and caused him to not be *present* during his trip. If he had not been *present* he would not have realized the opportunity that the trip provided for him to enjoy his time and build potential connections. These connections could prove to be long term investments which bear fruit, but that does not really matter to Siddhartha, they would simply be "happy little accidents" along the way.

Although often maligned in a workplace, "smelling the roses" can translate to potential professional success. An initiative for work seen as a 'long-term investment' or with as having somewhat marginal or purely educational gains may be adopted as a hobby project. But even if it does not translate to gains, enjoying your time and finding some joy as a byproduct of pursing your trade is key for fighting against one of the greatest dangers in the professional world: burnout.

### Real Knowledge - Not Head Knowledge

Again a confrontation between Kamaswami and Siddhartha sets the frame of an important concept.

> Once when Kamaswami was reproaching him by saying he had learned everything he knew from him, Siddhartha replied as follows: "You will have to come up with better jokes than that! From you I have learned how much a basket of fish costs and how much interest you can demand on borrowed money. But that is not real knowledge. I did not learn thinking from you, dear Kamaswami- better you should try to learn it from me." (pg.74)

As the confrontations between the two merchants add up, we see that Siddhartha appears to become increasingly annoyed with Kamaswami. Here, we see what appears to be the central theme of the chapter- the difference between true knowledge and head knowledge. This concept is often phrased as "life skills", "soft skills", or "wisdom".

In his job interview, Siddhartha did not lead off with his literacy and cunning being key skills. He instead offered up his ability to think, fast, and be patient. We saw this discipline translate into quick professional success. When Siddhartha "smelled the roses", it was his detachment from his career and his *present* statefulness that opened the door to new connections. These were the skills that were repeatedly highlighted throughout the chapter, not the "industry knowledge".

And this is why Siddhartha does not fear failure. The "life skills" that he  cultivated during his spiritual infancy are broadly applicable and allow him to be agile and versatile. He avoided overspecialization by placing greater emphasis on the development of these life skills versus amassing head knowledge, although the passage indicates he still dedicated effort to developing knowledge specific to his current trade.

## The Child People

The tensions with Kamaswami seemed to be a reflection of tensions between Siddhartha and mainstream society as a whole.

> He saw people going through their lives in the manner of a child or an animal, and he both loved and disdained this at the same time. He saw them striving... over things that seemed to him completely unworthy of this price: over money, over small pleasures, over a little respect. (pgs 74-75)

Throughout this chapter, Siddhartha explored the best that the professional world had to offer, but he again stopped and looked around and found that no one in this realm had attained nirvana. Both loving and disdaining the "child people" is particularly telling, we idealize the wonder and curiosity that children have but not their emotional immaturity. Siddhartha was beginning to see the cracks in living the child-like life of a sensate.

Later, Siddhartha analyzes himself and finds that everything he had been focusing on was merely a game while the true "stream of life" passed him by. Here, we see the first hints of regret at having "wasted time." The prior phases of his life were not wastes of time because in them Siddhartha developed the soft skills necessary to find nirvana, but here Siddhartha identified the happiness that he had found throughout his professional career as fake.

But what of his relationship with Kamala?

> You are the best lover I have ever encountered," she said thoughtfully... "You have learned my art well, Siddhartha. Someday, when I am older, I would like to have a child of yours. But in spite of all that, my dear, you have remained a shramana and do not love me. You love no one, is that not so?"

> "That may well be," Siddhartha said ***tiredly***. "I am like you. You too do not love; otherwise how could you practice love as an art? People of our type are perhaps incapable of love. The child people are capable of it; that is their secret (pg. 78; emphasis added)

Siddhartha is tired of the world of the child people. He toiled in order to master both professional success and eroticism, but still had not found nirvana. The child people are capable of feeling love and finding happiness and meaning in it, but Siddhartha, and possibly Kamala, are not capable of experiencing this kind of love. I wonder if it is because of the emotional detachment and the *present* statefulness which keeps them from it.

This rejection of love feels somewhat out of place in the novel, but remember that at this point in his life, Hesse had endured extreme loss. His wife was lost to schizophrenia and his children had to be given to others since due to Hesse's inability to support them. The interim between the writings of parts one and two of the novel saw Hesse experience serious mental health crises. Hesse was going through an extreme set of circumstances while writing this novel and an critical, if not cautious, stance towards love is understandable.

## Samsara

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Samsara" content="
We briefly touched upon the concept of Samsara in part one but now appears to be a good time to ensure we have a good grasp of it. Samsara is Sanskrit for 'wandering' but the term appears to be closer to aimless as opposed to purposeful wandering. It is  the cycle of rebirth, or the cycle of life. What is old is new again and what was new is now old, and so on and so forth. When one reaches nirvana, they break free from, or transcend, the cycle of Samsara."
%}

### Siddhartha Loses his Way

At this point in the story, Siddhartha had reached the heights of worldly success, though he did not reach nirvana. The cracks in this lifestyle had begun to show in the previous chapter, but unlike other stages of Siddhartha's life, he did not turn away when he realized that his current path did not lead to enlightenment. Instead,

> His senses, which he had mortified in his fervent shramana years, had reawakened. He tasted wealth, pleasure, and power... The sublime, brilliant wakefulness he had once known-- in the prime of his youth, in the days following Gotama's discourse, following the separation from Govinda-- that taut expectancy, that proud independence beyond learning and doctrine, that adaptable readiness to hear the divine voice in his own heart, had gradually become a memory, something transient. (pgs. 79-80).

The pleasures of the world were overpowering, even to the point of drowning out the profound experiences that Siddhartha encountered following his awakening after parting company from Govinda and Gotama. However, he was still unable to feel at home within the world of the "child people":

> Only gradually, amid his increasing riches, did Siddhartha himself take on something of the qualities of the child people, something of their childishness and fear. And yet he still envied them the one thing he still lacked and they possessed--the sense of importance they were able to attach to their lives, the ardor of their joys and fears, the timorous but sweet happiness of their eternal passion (pg. 81).

Although other passages indicates that Siddhartha still felt superior too the them, the child people were at least able to live in their own world in which they were able to feel experience emotions and attach meaning to their lives. *Timorous* indicates that the child people were unable to step outside of their comfort zone, but this is somewhat understandable. We often scorn the closed-minded for their unwillingness to step outside of their comfort zones by thinking critically about their beliefs and worldview, but if one has built a worldview that they find comfort and meaning in, then why would they be inclined to mess with it? They have reached a sort of stable state in an incredibly chaotic world, and many of these worldviews have been meticulously crafted and cultivated over generations, so it is understandable when one is not quick to throw away these worldviews to step out into the unknown as Siddhartha had.

### Siddhartha Develops some Vices

The situation worsens:

> The world had caught him-- pleasure, greed, and indifference-- and finally even the vice he had always despised and derided as the most foolish of all, craving for possessions (pg 81).

The allure of this world is powerful, that is a common theme among many of the major religious teachings. The very real threat of engaging in the lifestyle of a sensate is falling prey to vices and addiction. Aside from greed, Siddhartha also became addicted to gambling and began to recognize that his sense of superiority over his peers was developing into arrogant pride. The sensate lifestyle hinged around seeking new and powerful feelings, but because of this he fell prey to the feedback loop of the gambler's high-- there is always a better high, all one must do is play with higher stakes in the next round. In order to fuel his addictions, he devoted himself further to his profession.

### Siddhartha Faces Mortality

And now we finally arrive at the subject that is either at the forefront of everyone's mind or buried deep in their subconscious-- our mortality. So far the novel had been curiously silent on the subject, but here we see Siddhartha touch upon it for the first time.

> He was in his forties now, and had here and there noticed gray hairs among the black. Fatigue was written on Kamala's beautiful face, the fatigue of a long journey that has no happy destination, fatigue and a suggestion of fading, and also a concealed, not-yet-expressed, perhaps not-yet-conscious alarm: fear of old age, fear of autumn, fear of having to die. (pg. 86)

This revelation seemed to trigger some sort of personal crisis in Siddhartha's life, one that seemed delayed but which finally spurred him to action. During this personal crisis, Siddhartha experiences several dreams which appear to be his subconsciousness' method of "sounding the alarm". Following a dream that implied the impending death of Siddhartha's personal freedom, or perhaps the death of his spirituality in general:

> Waking suddenly from his dream, he was enveloped in profound sadness. It was all worthless! It seemed to him that he had led his life in a worthless and meaningless way. He was left with nothing alive, nothing in any way previous or worth holding on to. He was alone and destitute, like a shipwreck victim cast up on the shore. (pg. 87)

Recognizing the severity of this crisis, Siddhartha began to take inventory of the situation. He thought back to time when he felt true happiness and bliss. He felt it in his childhood when he was praised by the brahmins for his distinguished works as a young practitioner of the faith. He also felt it when hearing the inner voice motivating him to take further steps in his spiritual journey, such as when he left home to become a shramana and when he eventually left even that sect in order to seek Gotama.

Siddhartha identifies his life for what it is: samsara, the very thing that he was trying to break free from. He fled to one of his pleasure gardens and deeply ruminated under a mango tree. Suddenly, the revelations began to dawn on him:

> He smiled slightly-- was it necessary, was it right, was it not a foolish game, that he owned a mango tree, a garden? (pg. 89)

Siddhartha decided that it was time once again to change his path in life. He decided to walk away from everything.

## By The River

### Siddhartha Experiences The Lowest of Lows

It seems that our premonition from before about seeing the river again was correct. Siddhartha was once again at the river that he crossed after he left Gotama. However, this time his world was flipped completely upside down. Driven by disgust at himself for falling prey to the trap of worldly sensuality, Siddhartha sought to take his own life. However, he is accosted by a sudden intrusive thought- the word *OM*, which appears to be the Hindu equivalent to the western *Amen*. Saying the word caused Siddhartha to "know Brahman", "realize the indestructibility of life", and "recognize the dimension of divinity that he had forgotten. Wow!

After the sudden reversal from suicide attempt to apparent enlightenment, Siddhartha descends into a deep slumber and we learn more about the mighty word *OM*:

> Now, having reawakened, he looked at the world as a new man. Softly, he uttered the word *OM* which he had fallen asleep saying, and it seemed to him that his whole long sleep had been nothing else but a long, fully absorbed recitation of *OM*, a thinking of *OM*, a submersion and a total entry into *OM*, into the nameless, the prefect. (pgs. 94-95)"

How many times has Siddhartha "awakened" and seen the world as a new man? It is almost as if he has reincarnated multiple times, as if samsara is a cycle of phases within life. We see here that *OM* is nameless and perfect, which means that it will likely be difficult to grasp. Instead of attempting to grasp it, Siddhartha immerses himself fully within it.

### A Reunion

After awakening, Siddhartha found that his old friend Govinda had been watching over his sleeping body, although Govinda did not recognize Siddhartha due to the finery that he was wearing. Govinda does not seem to understand at all what is going with his old friend, and when asking how his old friend lost his wealth, Siddhartha responded:

> I lost it, or it me. It got away from me. The wheel of forms turns swiftly, Govinda. Where is the brahmin Siddhartha? Where is the shramana Siddhartha? Where is the rich man Siddhartha? That which is impermanent changes swiftly, as you know, Govinda. (pg. 98)

Siddhartha was fresh off of an existential crisis in which the impermanence of his form and all that he was pursing was highlighted. He identified this crisis as samsara, and states that the different stages of his life were different incarnations of Siddhartha. Govinda was doubtful and took his leave. However, we get a response from Siddhartha that is as of yet unique in the story.

> Siddhartha looked after him, a smile on his face. He still loved him, this loyal, fearful person. And how would it have been possible not to love anybody or anything at this moment, in this glorious time after his wonderful sleep pervaded by *OM*! That was precisely the magic that had worked in him by *OM* during his sleep-- that he loved everything... so it seemed to him now, that he had been so very sick before-- because he had been unable to love anything or anybody. (pgs 98-99)

Here we see that Siddhartha is expressing love! But was that not an attribute of the child people which Siddhartha was incapable of experiencing? *OM* has apparently granted Siddhartha the ability to feel love, and after one short session too! And not only was he capable of loving specific objects, but Siddhartha now apparently loved *everything*!

### How did this Happiness Come to Be?

Siddhartha immediately begins to examine how it was that he had encountered this profound and life-changing epiphany.

> My eyes laugh upon it. I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the level of the stupidest of all thoughts, the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience grade, to hear *OM* again, to sleep properly again and be able to awaken properly. (pg 101)

In order to experience pleasure, Siddhartha first had to know pain. This is a central concept to Taoism, if I recall correctly, and is represented by the yin-yang symbol. The light cannot exist without the dark. Light and dark both have no meaning unless they can be juxtaposed against one another. Siddhartha continues his analysis:

> It is good, he thought, to experience directly for oneself what one has to understand. I already understood as a child that the pleasures of the world and wealth are not good things. I understood that long ago, but I have only just now experienced it. And now I know it... (pg 103)

You have likely already learned firsthand the difference between learned knowledge and experiential knowledge-- it is an especially common lesson in one's teenage years. This also presents a frustration for the experienced. Often, we make mistakes or learn lessons the hard way in life and wish to make sure that others do not make the same mistakes. Sometimes people heed our advice, but sometimes they do not take it seriously or they simply decide that they need to see for themselves.

Siddhartha parted from the river.

> In this river Siddhartha had wanted to drown himself in it today, the old, tired, despairing Siddhartha had drowned. But the new Siddhartha felt a profound love toward this flowing stream and resolved not to leave it soon. (pg. 105)

The river is probably a metaphor but at this time the meaning eludes me. Perhaps the next chapter will shed some light.

## The Ferryman

### A Renunion

The river ended up becoming life changing for Siddhartha. And unlike the previous life changing experiences which seemed to fade over time, this one continuously renews Siddhartha. He discovers that the ferryman, named Vasudeva, from who gave him passage to the city many decades ago was still alive and also basking in the presence of the river. The two live a peaceful life of menial labor together as they commune with and are instructed by the river.

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Vasudeva" content="
This name appears to have a variety of meanings ranging from horse to lunar mansion to father of Krishna. *Vasu* itself as a noun appears to mean water and sweet as an adjective. There is also a situation in which it means \"spirit or soul considered as the Supreme Being or Soul of the universe\". Perhaps this is the atman? *Deva* means god, so it may be that Hesse is suggesting that the ferryman is the incarnation of some supreme being in the universe, or at the very least is implying that the ferryman is a supreme authority on the subject of spirituality."
%}

### The Teachings of the River

Despite being an apparently ultimate spiritual authority, Vasudeva insisted that he cannot teach Siddhartha and that it is the river which teaches the both of them. The river taught Siddhartha to listen and to "sink low" from his wealth to a menial position. Siddhartha has learned another life skill.

> Above all he learned from it (the river) how to listen, how to listen with a still heart, with an expectant, open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgment, without opinion (pg. 112).

The river also taught Siddhartha about time. When explaining to Vasudeva that the river revealed that there is no time, Vasudeva responded,

> This is probably what you mean: that the river is everywhere at once--at its source, at its mouth, by the waterfall, by the ferry crossing ... everywhere at the same time. And that for it there is only the present, not the shadow called the future (pg. 112).

I fear that the exact interpretation of this metaphor is lost on me as I am having a hard time wrapping my head around it. Maybe I am thinking too for outside of the scope of the analogy, but rivers are affected by seasonal affects like rainy seasons and periods of drought. Furthermore, once its source springs or glaciers dry up, the river too will come to an end. Perhaps what Vasudeva tried to do is correct Siddhartha's misinterpretation. The river solely exists and concerns itself with the present time, it is eternally *present* like Siddhartha sought to be. Time *does* indeed exist, but the river does not concern itself with any part of time except for the exact present.

Siddhartha extends this line of reasoning and realizes that much of the stress that people endure is because of worries about the future or dwelling upon the past. If someone was able to live wholly in the present, then those issues would not affect them and it would feel like great chains are being shed from their body.

### A Model for Spiritual Development

It is possible that the river represents the stream of thoughts and observations passing by Siddhartha's consciousness. Siddhartha is off to the side witnessing this stream as outlined earlier in the novel. He learns much from his observations of the world, but he still confers with Vasudeva, an individual of greater experience and spiritual maturity, to confirm and expound upon his observations. This feels like a very good and simple model for spiritual development.

### Another Reunion

Word had spread far and wide that Gotama was nearing the end of his days and thus would break free of samsara. Kamala, who at this point had a son named Siddhartha, decided to go witness the passing. The two of them begin their journey and near the spot where Siddhartha Sr. and Vasudeva work. Kamala is bitten by a venomous snake and is brought to the dwelling of the ferrymen. Although she is reunited with Siddhartha Sr. in the final moments of her life and obtains peace, she dies, leaving the son in the hands of his father. While reflecting upon the visage of his dead wife, Siddhartha observes:

> He felt profoundly at that moment, more profoundly than ever, the indestructibility of life, the eternity of every instant (pg. 121).

## The Son

Siddhartha Jr. was a spoiled child raised in the lap of luxury. Siddhartha Sr. decided against bringing the child back to the city and instead raised him by the river hoping that the child would experience peace and learn the teachings of the river. However, this does not go according to plan. The son spites the father and heaps many forms of torment and tantrums upon him. The father responds with peace and gentleness, but over time it becomes increasingly apparent that Siddhartha Jr. was not gaining anything from living by the river. Vasudeva remained silent through the years, but finally offered comment:

> Water seeks water, youth seeks youth. Your son is not in a place where he can flourish. You ask the river yourself, you listen to it! (pg. 125)

It is clear from this statement that the river is not the be-all-end-all solution to finding peace for everyone. Siddhartha Jr. was raised in a different environment, had a different set of experiences, and thus had a different set of needs that evoke different responses. The river would not give Siddhartha Jr. peace in the same way that it would not give peace to everyone. By stating, "you ask the river yourself, you listen to it," Vasudeva is simply saying "observe with an open mind for yourself.

Siddhartha Sr. asks for more time and pleads that his peaceful and acquiescent stance would cause Siddhartha Jr. to love him more, but Vasudeva countered stating that his failure to discipline and act regarding his son's behavior is in fact a cruel punishment of its own. Siddhartha Sr. worried that his son will repeat his same mistakes, but Vasudeva responded:

> Do you really believe you committed your follies so you could save your son from them? Can you protect your son from samsara? How could you? Through teaching, through prayer, through warnings? ... But even if you were to die for him ten times over, you would not be able to subtract the tiniest fragment from his fate. (pg. 127)

Despite all of the accumulated experience and knowledge that Siddhartha had obtained throughout his many journeys through life, there was nothing that he could do to sway the beliefs or change the fate of his son. In the same way that he let go concern for the future and past to live in the present, he must let go of the notion that he can directly affect the spiritual development of his son. Instead, he must ensure that he is being raised in an environment that is suitable for his development and recognize that what affected his personal life may not affect his son's life in the same way.

The mountain of spiritual incompatibility between the father and son had grown so damaged that it appeared insurmountable. So what to do in this situation? Vasudeva counseled that the father let the son go free and seek his own fate. The son eventually runs away, and Vasudeva counseled that the father leave him to his fate, but Siddhartha gave chase to his son. The journey took him back to the pleasure garden where he met Kamala, and the turmoil with his son coupled with the memories and loss of Kamala caused Siddhartha to lose his *present* stance and sink into a catatonic state. He is eventually found and brought back to the present by Vasudeva, and they continue living their life of peace.

At first glance, it appears that Vasudeva is encouraging that parents kick children out of their homes if it becomes obvious that the home environment is not conducive to their growth. However, this is metaphoric-- please do not kick your children out of your homes. Instead, "letting the son go" meant that Siddhartha Sr. should no longer attempt to force his beliefs upon his son and instead allow the son to observe and grow his own set of beliefs. After all, referring back to the model outlined in the previous chapter, the river is the observations and thoughts of each person's consciousness so the river is deeply personal to each person. If Siddhartha's son is being forced to witness and observe what his father wants him to, he is not truly "listening to the river". Now it is beginning to become apparent why this text is considered foundational for the Unitarian movement.
