## Introduction

This article assumes that you have read the first. If you have not done so already, please do. Otherwise, let's dive right in.

## Kamala - Exploring Sensuality

### Being Present

Siddhartha had been reborn and sees the world in a different light. Now he had become truly "present" in this world and was starting to mind things that he once would have glossed over while focusing on something which was not present. Speaking regarding the details of nature and the world around him, Hesse writes regarding Siddhartha,

> But now his unfettered vision dwelt here- he saw and acknowledged the visible, sought his home in this world. He no longer pursued the essence or looked toward the beyond. The world was beautiful when one just looked at it without looking for anything, just simply, as a child... All of this had always been there, and he had not seen it. He had not been there with it (pgs. 49-50).

Being "present" is an important skill for high-focus tasks but also key for enjoying activities such as travelling. Often times, it is stress or unnecessary thoughts that keep us from being "present". The ability to become "present" on demand also means that one can redirect these thoughts and put them off until a time that something can be done about those concerns.

Siddhartha also adopted a stance of "childlike wonder", seeing the world as if for the first time and not demanding anything from it. He simply saw things and enjoyed seeing them.

### Becoming a Sensate - Chasing Beauty

Siddhartha quickly realized that the beauty around him was not limited to passive observation. Seeing was one thing, but there were so many other senses that he was denying from experiencing beauty. On his path, Siddharta found a river and was struck by its beauty. He encountered a ferryman that offered to take him across the river for free. When thanked for his hospitality, the ferryman comments that he expects Siddhartha will return to cross the river again one day.

The river appears to be a metaphor for crossing into a life as a sensate. It represents a stage in life when person is free from the children's creche of their spiritual development and begins to see the world with "open eyes". It feels analogous to a college student leaving the house to experience the world for the first time and it reminds me of the "Grand Tours" of Europe taken by the upper classes as part of a "classical education".

### The City - Finding your Way in the World

After a long journey, Siddhartha reached the city. Very soon after his entrance to the city, he witnessed a procession entering a pleasure garden. The procession centered around a woman of extreme beauty by the name of Kamala. Siddhartha is enraptured by Kamala and quickly seeks to gain her favor so that he may experience romance with her, something that he had denied himself throughout his entire life.

In this section, Hesse once again seems to be using a *maximal case*. In past sections, we saw Siddhartha be the best he could be at organized religion, experience the fullest extent of asceticism, and interact with somebody who had achieved enlightment. Because the "maximal cases" of these different paths did not bring him any closer to his goal of enlightment, he was able to rule those paths out and pursue different ones. I suspect that Kamala represents the "epitome" of beauty and we are left to see whether partaking in that beauty will directly cause Siddhartha to acheive enlightment.

Siddhartha makes his romantic intentions clear to Kamala. His poetry attracts him, but Kamala laments that their stations in life are simply too different. Siddhartha must acheive material wealth and social stature if he is to engage Kamala romantically, but the skills that he developed while pursuing his former paths appear remarkably worthless- all but one. He could think and he could think very well. Furthermore, he was capable of focusing his will with extreme intensity, meaning that once Siddhartha identified a goal, he could pursue it with extreme efficiency. Kamala gave Siddhartha a kiss as a parting gift along with a recommendation to an open staff position with one of the city's top merchants.

### Reaction

It is very interesting that although Siddhartha seems to have found what he belives to be the correct path towards enlightment, he does not appear to experience any sense of frustration or loss at having "wasted" so much time in life pursuing dead ends.

Another common issue with the pursuit of beauty is that experiencing beauty often comes with a price tag. It is expensive to travel to the world's most beautiful places. It costs a lot of money to eat fine foods and drink fine drinks. Attending art galleries is expensive. Beautiful people understand the value of their relationships and tend to seek to engage with those of sufficient finanical standing. Siddhartha hit the financial firewall around beauty very quickly, yet he did not dismay. He identified a path to success, created and leveraged a connection, and then set to meet his financial goals as quickly as possible.

It is unfortunate that a certain level of financial standing and stability is required to pursue certain paths in life, but acheiving this financial security can be considered as another part of the spiritual "children's creche". Common rites of passages for middle class westerners are to acheive a profession, marry a spouse, and purchase property. After securing financial freedom, companionship, and a home, the individual is free to pursue their passions. I wonder if the pursuit of these passions are often mis-identified as "mid-life crises".

## Among the Child People

In this chapter, Siddhartha pursues a professional career. As mentioned in the last chapter, careers are important as they often provide what is necessary to pursue your paths in life. Although it is unlikely that a professional career in itself will allow someone to reach nirvana, it is considered a "must-have" by most. A lot of the content of this chapter is great advice for a young professional.

### The Importance of Discipline and Patience in the Professional World

With the help of Kamala's recommendation, Siddhartha began his professional career as a merchant. At first, the merchant Kamaswami was hesitant to hire on Siddhartha because his only profession of skill was, "I can think, I can wait, I can fast" (pg. 68). Although at first glance fasting seems useless, the key skills behind fasting are patience and restraint. People who exercise patience and restraint are able to endure periods of hardship or derth in order to achieve greater rewards at a later time. Discipline is in general seen as a desireable trait in the professional world as it often translates to level-headed decision making, self-improvement, and willingness to take the best kind of risks, those which are carefully calculated.

Interestingly, Siddhartha had skills which were relevant to being a merchant, such as reading and writing. However, he did not seem to view these as skills worth noting, hinting at a concept that will be touched upon later in this chapter. We are left with this saying to wet our appetites for an important concept:

> Writing is good, thinking is better. Cleverness is good, patience is better (pg. 69)

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Kamaswami" content="
The word *swami* may seem familiar to you, as its meaning of *master* is somewhat common knowledge in the west. *Kama* refers to erotic love and *kamasu* can refer to fulfilling the desires and gratifying wishes. So *Kamaswami* appears to rough translates to a *master of erotic desires*. Just as Kamala represents the ultimate object of erotic desire, so does Kamaswami represent the ultimate obtainer of these desires."

### Avoiding Deep Attachments to Careers - Smelling the Roses

Siddhartha's career started off well. He won some deals, he lost some deals, and used the earnings from his career to begin his romantic relationship with the courtesan Kamala. Kamaswami notes:

> He was quick to see that Siddhartha understood little about rice and wool, ships' voyages and business dealing, but that he had a lucky touch, and that Siddhartha exceeded his own ability or calmess and equanimity, in the art of listending, and in the seeing into the hearts of strangers... He always gives the impression of merely toying with business dealings. He never gets truly involved in them, they never dominate his mind; he never fears failure, is never bothered by loss. (pg. 71)

Although he was not raised in the world of business and still did not seem to be catching on to the fine details (or "specializing" in his trade), Siddhartha's mindset enabled him to be successful nonetheless. Further descriptions in the chapter depict Siddhartha's seemingly nonchalant approach to the successes and failures of his career. This may seem offputting to some some, as it did to Kamaswami. However, a professional career, indeed life itself, is rollarcoaster of inevitable ups and downs. Although we are often times forced to ride these ups and downs, we do not have to choose to take part in them emotionally. By detaching ourselves from the ups and downs emotionally (think of the *witness conscious* from the first part of the novel), we can obtain the same sense of level-headedness that Siddhartha had and become disciplined in our actions.

At this point it is good to remember that this novel deals very much so with ideal cases. "Having no fear of failure" may work in this novel's world but we need to keep a healthy respect of the fact that failure is a part of life, is sometimes entirely out of our control, and needs to be recognized and accepted as a possibility. However, it appears that Siddhartha's lack of fear from failure comes from him knowing that his skillset, "thinking, waiting, and fasting" will enable him to easily endure and quickly rebound from failure. This again teases at a what I feel is a central concept of this chapter.

### Smelling the Roses - Even at Work

At one point Siddhartha travels to a village and quickly realizes that there the business opportunity which was once present was there no longer. Instead of cutting losses and returning home, as many business people would do, he instead stayed in the village for several days to enjoy his time, attend social events, and build relationships. Kamaswami confronted Siddhartha about this apparent misuse of time and funds (it is worth noting at this point that Siddhartha had been given a third of the business and he was fully responsible for its earnings and losses, so this affront was not as greivous as it would be if the money he was spending were not "his"). Although Kamaswami's stance was both confrontational and accusatory, Siddhartha remains emotionally attached in his reponse, albeit with a touch of superiority,

> "Definitely," laughed Siddhartha, "I definitely took that trip for pleasure. Why else? I got to know people and places, I enjoyed hospitality and trust, I found friendship. You see, my friend, if I had been Kamaswami, as soon as I saw that my business deal was foiled, I would have turned around instantly and come back home totally upset. The time and money would have in fact been lost. But in my case I had a few good days, learned things, had a good time, and harmed neither myself nor anyone else through anger in haste. And if I ever go back there... I will be warmly and kindly received by friendly people... (pg. 73)

If Siddhartha had been riding the rollarcoaster of a deep emotional attachment with his career, the loss of the deal would have soured his mood and caused him to not be *present* during his trip. If he had not been *present* he would not have realized the opportunity that the trip provided for him to enjoy his time and build potential connections. These connections could prove to be long term investments which bear fruit, but that does not really matter to Siddhartha, they would simply be "happy little accidents" along the way.

Although often maligned in a workplace, "smelling the roses" can translate to potential professional success. An initiative for work seen as a 'long-term investment' or with as having somewhat marginal or purely educational gains may be adopted as a hobby project. But even if it does not translate to gains, enjoying your time and finding some joy as a byproduct of pursing your trade is key for fighting against one of the greatest dangers in the professional world: burnout.

### Real Knowledge - Not Head Knowledge

Again a confrontation between Kamaswami and Siddhartha sets the frame of an important concept.

> Once when Kamaswami was reproaching him by saying he had learned everything he knew from him, Siddhartha replied as follows: "You will have to come up with better jokes than that! From you I have learned how much a basket of fish costs and how much interest you can demand on borrowed money. But that is not real knowledge. I did not learn thinking from you, dear Kamaswami- better you should try to learn it from me." (pg.74)

As the confrontations between the two merchants add up, we see that Siddhartha appears to become increasingly annoyed with Kamaswami. Here, we see what appears to be the central theme of the chapter- the difference between true knowledge and head knowledge. This concept is often phrased as "life skills", "soft skills", or "wisdom".

In his job interview, Siddhartha did not lead off with his literacy and cunning being key skills. He instead offered up his ability to think, fast, and be patient. We saw this discipline translate into quick professional success. When Siddhartha "smelled the roses", it was his detachment from his career and his *present* statefulness that opened the door to new connections. These were the skills that were repeatedly highlighted throughout the chapter, not the "industry knowledge".

And this is why Siddhartha does not fear failure. The "life skills" that he  cultivated during his spiritual infancy are broadly applicable and allow him to be agile and versatile. He avoided overspecialization by placing greater emphasis on the development of these life skills versus amassing head knowledge, although the passage indicates he still dedicated effort to developing knowledge specific to his current trade.

## The Child People

The tensions with Kamaswami seemed to be a reflection of tensions between Siddhartha and mainstream society as a whole.

> He saw people going through their lives in the manner of a child or an animal, and he both loved and disdained this at the same time. He saw them striving... over things that seemed to him completely unworthy of this price: over money, over small pleasures, over a little respect. (pgs 74-75)

Throughout this chapter, Siddhartha explored the best that the professional world had to offer, but he again stopped and looked around and found that no one in this realm had attained nirvana. Both loving and disdaining the "child people" is particularly telling, we idealize the wonder and curiousity that children have but not their emotional immaturity. Siddhartha was beginning to see the cracks in living the child-like life of a sensate.

Later, Siddhartha analyzes himself and finds that everything he had been focusing on was merely a game while the true "stream of life" passed him by. Here, we see the first hints of regret at having "wasted time." The prior phases of his life were not wastes of time because in them Siddhartha developed the soft skills necessary to find nirvana, but here Siddhartha identified the happiness that he had found throughout his professional career as fake.

But what of his relationship with Kamala? 

> You are the best lover I have ever encounterd," she said thoughfully... "You have learned my art well, Siddhartha. Someday, when I am older, I would like to have a child of yours. But in spite of all that, my dear, you have remained a shramana and do not love me. You love no one, is that not so?" 

> "That may well be," Siddhartha said ***tiredly***. "I am like you. You too do not love; otherwise how could you practice love as an art? People of our type are perhaps incapable of love. The child people are capable of it; that is their secret (pg. 78; emphasis added)

Siddhartha is tired of the world of the child people. He toiled in order to master both professional success and eroticism, but still had not found nirvana. The child people are capable of feeling love and finding happiness and meaning in it, but Siddhartha, and possibly Kamala, are not capable of experiencing this kind of love. I wonder if it is because of the emotional detachment and the *present* statefulness which keeps them from it.

This rejection of love feels somewhat out of place in the novel, but remember that at this point in his life, Hesse had endured extreme loss. His wife was lost to schiziophrenia and his children had to be given to others since due to Hesse's inability to support them. The interim between the writings of parts one and two of the novel saw Hesse experience serious mental health crises. Hesse was going through an extreme set of circumstances while writing this novel and an critical, if not cautious, stance towards love is understandable.
