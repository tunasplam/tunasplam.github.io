# Siddharta - Hermann Hesse
Shambala Library, 2000

## Introduction

I am finally getting around to this one. This is an outline of some details picked up from the introduction that I want to pay attention to. Split into two articles maybe, part 1 and part 2 since it sounds like part 1 was followed by a pause that was caused by mental health issues on Hesse's part. He said "part 2 requires a next step in spiritual awakening that I have not yet taken" or smth like that.

Influenced by Jung and psychoanalysis.
Zen Ox-Herding Pictures
Maybe go through "Stages of Gried" analysis as well.

The path of Siddharta:

- Orthodox religion
- Life-denying asceticism
- Affirmation of self and enjoyment of sensuality in the material world
- Analysis and intellectualism
- *Giving up on spiritualism?*

"There is total dignity and freedom, surety and cosmic correctness, in not having to attend one's funeral." - Translator's Preface

*Very similar life path to mine. Possible that I am currently on "analysis and intellectualism"*

The introduction specifies that although this is considered a great overview of eastern philosophy, it is not entirely true to the beliefs of Buddhism and certain themes (such as ablution from sin) were inserted due to the strong influence of Western Protestantism on Hesse's upbringing.

A friend of mine reminded me of Siddharta. Unfortunately, he did not survive his journey.

# The Journey

## The Brahmin's Son - An Upbringing in Organized Religion

### The Origin Story

The first chapter of the story introduces Siddharta, his loyal companion Govinda, and his father, an accomplished and respected spiritual leader who had fared very well raising his son in the teaching of their religion. Siddharta was renowned as an knowledgeable and devout believer. His adoration seemed universal.

However, Siddharta was unsatisfied. Although participating in organized religion pleased others and elevated him to a coveted position in society, a life of ease and popularity, Siddarta felt that something was missing.

Govinda observed,

> Siddharta would never become an ordinary brahmin, a lazy purveyor of rituals, a greedy dealer in charms, a vain mouther of empty phrases, a base and devious priest, nor would he become a mindless good sheep in the common herd (pg. 4).

Our protaganist did not fit within the confines of organized religion because his morals and desire to seek the truth made formal ministry work unappealing while his deep spirituality and questioning mind precluded any chance of him becoming a mindless practitioner.

### What was missing?

A list of issues that Siddharta was facing soon followed. He felt uneasy and sought for peace of mind, a content heart, true ablution from sin, and to encounter the "inmost essence", an "ultimate principle". As children are inclined to do, he first looked to his father for the answers, observing in silence.

> But even his father, who knew so much- did he live in holy bliss, and had he found contetment? Was he too, not only a seeker, still thirsting? Did he not have to slake his thirst again and again at the sacred springs-the rites, the books, the discources of the brahmins? Why did he, blameless as he was, ahve to wash away his sins each day? Was atman not within him? Did the primordial spring not flow in his own heart? *That is what had to be found-the primordial spring within one's self*; one had to become master of that! Anything else was a vain quest, a false quest, a misunderstanding. (pg. 8; emphasis added)

Here we see that although he recognized that his father's beliefs did not hold the answer, but in experiencing these beliefs, exploring them to their fullest, and keeping an open mind, Siddharta was able to identify what was missing and seek after it. This "primordial spring within one's self" is reminiscent of the concept of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in traditional western Christian theology.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Atman" content="
I had no clue what Atman was when I encountered it in this chapter, so here are the results of a brief investigation. It is a Hindu term roughly referring to the concept of a \"self-existent essence or impersonal wintess-consciousness wihtin each individual\". This teaching feels reminiscent of several concepts I have come across in secular resources regarding mental health, so it is very interesting to find that the tactic of taking the role of a witness consciousness and observing your thoughts as they pass but not choosing to interact or identify with them has possible roots in Hinduism."

### The Father's Reaction

Siddharta had to leave the religion of his father, but he needed to make his family aware of his choice. The father's reaction to the news is powerful. Siddharta's announcement was followed by a long period of silence, and then responded,

> "It is not fitting for a brahmin to speak hard and agry words, yet in my heart I cannot accept this. Do not let this request cross your lips a second time." (pg 12)

However, Siddharta responds in an unconventional manner, he stood in one place and stared into the distance for hours on end to prove the sincerity of his plight. This concept of peaceful protest was used often during the Indian Independence movement but appeared radical to westerners until its efficacy was proven during the American Civil Rights movement. The protest moves his father and his response is an important example of an alternative to staunch, dogmatic traditionalism.

> "You will go off to the forest," he said, "and become a shramana. If you find happiness in the forest, come back and teach me happiness. If it's disappointment you find, then come back and we shall again make sacrifices to the gods together." (pg. 13)

The father recognized that his son had reached a point of maturity and respected his son's autonomy and desire to seek the truth. He set his son free but ensured that he knew that he always had a safety net in his family.

## Reaction

Organized religion is important, even for those who leave it to seek the truth or to truly better themselves as people. It gives a solid foundation and ensures that they are somewhat in tune or at least aware of the generally accepted beliefs within their culture. This is important because it allows someone to seek fulfillment without coming across as a crazed heretic. It also allows them to relate easier with those who are struggling and need guidance but are not aware of the creed of the one who is helping them.

As an aside, the mindless are not dumb, they are simply not tuned spiritually yet recognize the social value of "fitting" in a religious setting. Some people have different callings to their lives. Maybe they are interested specifically in their trades, hobbies, or families. Not everyone is interested in spiritual truths about themselves or the universe. Sometimes churches and temples are social clubs where people build community and that is okay because thats is likely the whole point of organized religion and a major reason why it has thrived for so long.

Regardless of these points, this was a fantastic chapter. I would be curious to read Hesse's own thoughts on the value of his upbringing in organized religion to his spiritual journey. The first chapter of the book did an excellent job briefly setting the stage, introducing the characters and their backstories, relaying their problems, and outlining the goal of the journey that they will take over the course of the novel. Although written in narrative form, the structure of this book so far feels like it was made transparent on purpose so that readers will be able to easily deduce the conclusions that the author intended to communicate.

# With the Shramanas - Going Back to the Basics

### An overview of Asceticism

Asceticism is a concept that seems to be pervasive across different religions of the world. Most religions include some form of fasting or strenuous self-discipline to help focus the practitioner on higher purposes. I believe that asceticism has merit and that we use similar concepts in our day-to-day lives. Consider programming for example. When encountering a tough bug in software that needs to be identified and understood, a common tactic is to first create a *minimal reproducible example* by cutting out everything which is not necessary for the purpose of solving the problem in order to focus our efforts and quickly reach a solution. I believe that asceticism serves a similar purpose, stripping down life to a bare minimum in order to focus your efforts on a particular problem or goal.

However, our software analogy highlights a *temporary measure* -- once the bug is fixed, the minimal reproducible example is discarded and our changes are incorporated into our main program. I believe asceticism should be approached in a similar manner, as a temporary measure to help us identify changes that need to be made in our lives. Once the changes are identified and practiced enough, the ascetic period can end and normal life altered with the learnings from the time of concentrated effort can begin.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Shramanas" content="
Shramana seems to be a general term for a practitioner of an eastern religion who subscribes to a ascetic or austere lifestyle. Their religious beliefs appear to be extremely varied and it seems safe to equate Shramanas to the monks or penitents that we are familiar with in our culture."
