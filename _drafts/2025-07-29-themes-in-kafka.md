# Themes Present in the works of Franz Kafka

Kafka is a fantastic author. He even has a term coined after him - *kafkaesque*. Of course, I had read the Metamorphosis and several other short stories by Kafka and had a vague notion of what the term meant, but I kept seeing that term thrown around so often that I started to wonder if I should revisit his works to answer the question "what does it mean for something to be *kafkaesque*. The short answer, anything that is reminiscient of one of Kafka's typical themes. In this article, I will sum up some of the recurring themes present in his short stories. This is by no means an exhaustive list and there are more than one interpretation of these texts.

## Struggles between a boy and his father

A common recurring theme in Kafka's stories is a strained relationship between a boy and his father. In these relationships, there is often disappointment or even revulsion directed from the father to the son. Often times, this revulsion and disappointment is puzzling to both the son and the reader. The sons are sometimes wildly successful by society's standards but yet fail to live up to the wild and arcane expectations held by the father.

### Some works where this theme is present

-  *The Judgement*: A remarkably successful businessman contends with the rapid degeneration of his father's health. The father lashes out violently at his son as he his mental faculties slowly fade. The whole work is presented like a seesaw. The story is told from the point of view of the son and for the majority of the story the mood and outlook of the tale ascends. This continues until a sudden reversal due to a suprising outburst from the father. From this point onwards, the mood of the tale descends rapidly into darkness.

- *The Stoker* - The theme is less pronounced here, but the story hinges around the journey that a young boy takes because of his parents exiling him from his home and country. The exile appears somewhat frivolous to readers and the work suggests that perhaps the parents were ready and willing to pull the trigger after the slightest misstep from their son without any chance for him to plead his case.

- *Eleven Sons* - This work is perhaps the most overt example of this theme. The narrative is told in the form of a father relating his opinions of his eleven sons. The father describes his son as a botanist would describe his breeds of plants. He does not think highly of his sons, and it is apparent from the work that his sons do not think very highly of him either.

- *The Fratricide* - A short story that relates a murder. The only clue that this could be another manifestation of the father-son dynamic is the title.

## Judgement being passed without any defense from the accused (Impersonal Condemnation)

The passing of judgement from a higher party to a lesser one without any opporunity for the accused to defend themselve also plays a prominent role in Kafka's works.

- *The Penal Colony* - EXPAND The officer goes on about how this was important under the old regime or something like that.

- *The Stoker* - EXPAND The parents quick willingness to exile their son.

- *The Judgement* - EXPAND The father's mental illness makes it impossible for the son to defend himself.

## The Absurd (often times linked with Bureaucracy)

- *The New Advocate* - EXPAND Alexander the Great's horse transitioning to law late in his life?

- *A Country Doctor* - EXPAND yeah this ones going to take some thought

- *An Old Manuscript* - EXPAND maybe?

- *Before the Law* - EXPAND

- *An Imperial Message* - EXPAND

## Final Notes
I plan on revisiting some of Kafka's other works such as Amerika in the future and will hopefully incorporate them into this article.
