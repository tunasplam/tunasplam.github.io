# Kafka on the Shore
First Vintage International Edition, 2006.

## Summary
A boy runs away from home, an autistic man has a complicated back story, and everyone goes on a wild journey that walks along the border of reality (and occasionally dips slightly outside of it).

## Reaction
This was a great book. Another prime example of the light-surrealist/magical realism that Murakami specializes in. As usual, semiotics is a key component of the story although not as much as some of his other works like Sputnik Sweetheart or Wonderland. The novel starts slow but really immerses you into the world that the characters live in. Once plotlines start tying together, the pace picks up and its difficult to put the book down. Conversations between Kafka (not the author, there is a character in the story who adopts the monikor) and Oshima are very fascinating and provide great connections to explore.

One thing I wonder about Murakami is if he has intended messages in his novels or if he leaves the messages intentionally vague to allow people to draw the conclusions that they feel like they need. In this sense, these novels feel somewhat like esoteric religious texts.

## Notable Quotes/Passages

### 1. Responsibility extends to our dreams and imagination

> Our responsiblity begins with the power to imagine... In dreams begin responsibilities. (pgs. 132-133)

This quote comes as Kafka is reading a book regarding Eichmann (presumably Arendt's Banality of Evil, a very impactful read). It later ties into a key event where Kafka rapes his friend in a dream. The event potentially, although the exact details are somewhat vague, affects Kafka's relationship with said friend. Some meaning from these passages that stuck out to me is that its possible that our actions in our dreams and in our imagination could affect our subconcious and spill unintentionally into reality. Responsibility begins (or "also applies") to our dreams and imagination.

### 2. A philosopher's conundrum

> ...people build up meaning between themselves and the things around them. The important thing is whether this comes about naturally or not. Being bright has nothing to do with it. What matters is that you see things with your own eyes. ... It isn't a question of intelligence. I'm not all that bright, I just have my own way of thinking. That's why people get disgusted with me. They accuse me of always bringing up things that are better left alone. If you try to use your head to think about things, people don't want to have anything to do with you. (pg. 189)

Spoken by a random truck driver who has a lot of time to think about things and, because of his position in life, sees a very different side of the world than the average person. Philosopher's are generally people who love to understand things. Indeed, the etymology of the word philospher itself suggests this. When people try to understand things, they question them. Those who have a different perspective on reality or have a different worldview can have concerns or questions about things that differ dramatically from the typical person around them. Some of these concerns or questions may be in the average person's blindspot and cause discomfort when brought up. This is often why philosophers tend to not be very popular people.

### 3. A possible definition of maturity
> The longer people live, the more they learn to distinguish what's important and what's not. (pg. 353)

The longer people live, the more aware they become of their impermanence. As they begin to age, they may recognize the scarcity of time or the limits of their emotional capacity and begin to prioritize some things over others. This is another way to think about maturity.

### 4. Parting thoughts

> Time weighs down on you like an old, ambiguous dream. You keep on moving, trying to slip through it. But even if you go to the ends of the earth, you won't be able to escape it. Still, you have to go there - to the edge of the world. There's something there that you can't do unless you get there. (pg. 467)

This is one of the final passages in the book. It sums up what seems to be one of the central themes of this novel (as well as many of his other novels) which is the impermanence of all things. Spouses die, memories fade, great works of culture are forgotten, things that were once popular are in storage rooms collecting dust, all of these themes are repeatedly brought up throughout the novel. At the end of the novel, these themes may be weighing heavily on you. Nevertheless, time keeps moving forward and at some point, you too will die.
