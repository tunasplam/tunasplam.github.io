## Introduction

### Motivation

When I was in college, I had a humanities class where one of the students had recently finished reading Siddhartha. He was a self-proclaimed hedonist, a massive fan of the philosphy of Jim Morrison, and an all around cool dude. I figured that at one point I would read this book, but my humanities professor had just introduced me to the worlds of cyberpunk and utopian novels, so that kept me occupied for a few years. But now, I have finally decided to pick this novel up to see if it will be the experience that my classmate related it as.

### Story Background

Hesse was the son of two generations of Christian missionaries. His grandfather was particularly well learned regarding the Indian subcontinent, and was apparently regarded by some as a leading expert in the field. He actively encourged the young Hesse to understand eastern religions and philosophies. Eventually, the brutality of World War I and several deep personal crises caused Hesse to embark on a journey of self discovery, of which this novel was a product of.

The introduction specifies that although this is considered a great overview of eastern philosophy, it is not entirely true to the beliefs of Buddhism and certain themes (such as ablution from sin) are included due to the strong influence of Western Protestantism on Hesse's upbringing.

The novel was a major success and was quickly translated into languages across the world. It sparked entire spiritual movements in America, many of which still thrive today.

Throughout the story Siddhartha embarks on a journey with several stages:

- **Orthodoxy:** organized religion
- **Asceticism:** escaping one's self through deprivation and struggle 
- **Hedonism:** Affirmation of self and enjoyment of sensuality in the material world
- **Intellectualism:** Deep, formal analysis
- ***Giving up on spiritualism?***

I emphasized the last stage because I did not expect that to be how the journey ends. I am very curious to see how this goes. Apparently, the story relates to the *Zen Ox-Herding Pictures*, which I intend to learn about in more depth at some point while reading this novel. The novel is also apparently influenced by the psychoanalysis movement in Europe and particularly by the works of Carl Jung. Hesse had a few sessions with Jung himself.

### Post Structure

The novel is split into two parts, each of which contains chapters which relate a different stage in the protaganist's journey. I will be writing a section for each chapter immediately after having read through them.

### Dedication

This post is dedicated in memory of a friend whose life closely mirrored that of Siddhartha's. A son of a minister, exceptionally bright, acutely tuned to matters of spirituality and morality, beloved by many -- yet plagued with the same unease and discontent as Siddhartha.

## The Brahmin's Son - An Upbringing in Organized Religion

### The Origin Story

The first chapter of the story introduces Siddhartha, his loyal companion Govinda, and his father, an accomplished and respected spiritual leader who had fared very well raising his son in the teachings of their religion. Siddhartha was renowned as a knowledgeable and devout believer. His adoration seemed universal.

However, Siddhartha was unsatisfied. Although participating in organized religion pleased others and elevated him to a coveted position in society, a life of ease and popularity, Siddarta felt that something was missing.

Govinda observed,

> Siddhartha would never become an ordinary brahmin, a lazy purveyor of rituals, a greedy dealer in charms, a vain mouther of empty phrases, a base and devious priest, nor would he become a mindless good sheep in the common herd (pg. 4).

Our protaganist did not fit within the confines of organized religion because his morals and desire to seek the truth made formal ministry work unappealing while his deep spirituality and questioning mind precluded any chance of him becoming a mindless practitioner.

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Siddhartha" content="
Possible Sanskrit interpretations include *successful* and *prosperous* but perhaps more relevant to the novel are the meanings *one whose aim or intention is know* or *one who has accomplished an aim or object*." 
%}

### What was missing?

A list of issues that Siddhartha was facing soon followed. He felt uneasy and sought for peace of mind, a content heart, true ablution from sin, and to encounter the "inmost essence", an "ultimate principle". As children are inclined to do, he first looked to his father for the answers, observing in silence.

> But even his father, who knew so much- did he live in holy bliss, and had he found contentment? Was he too, not only a seeker, still thirsting? Did he not have to slake his thirst again and again at the sacred springs-the rites, the books, the discources of the brahmins? Why did he, blameless as he was, have to wash away his sins each day? Was atman not within him? Did the primordial spring not flow in his own heart? *That is what had to be found-the primordial spring within one's self*; one had to become master of that! Anything else was a vain quest, a false quest, a misunderstanding. (pg. 8; emphasis added)

Siddhartha recognized that his father's beliefs did not hold the answer, but by experiencing these beliefs, exploring them to their fullest, and keeping an open mind, Siddhartha was able to identify what was missing and seek after it. This "primordial spring within one's self" is reminiscent of the concept of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in traditional western Christian theology.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Atman" content="
I had no clue what Atman was when I encountered it in this chapter, so here are the results of a brief investigation. It is a Hindu term roughly referring to the concept of a \"self-existent essence or impersonal witness-consciousness within each individual\". It appears that some view the Atman as a single unifying being similar in nature to Thoreau's *Oversoul* and subsequent references to the Atman in the novel appear to line up with this belief. This teaching feels reminiscent of several concepts I have come across in secular resources regarding mental health, so it is very interesting to find that the tactic of taking the role of a witness consciousness and observing your thoughts as they pass while abstaining from interaction with or identification with them has possible roots in Hinduism."

### The Father's Reaction

Siddhartha had to leave the religion of his father, but he needed to make his family aware of his choice. The father's reaction to the news is powerful. Siddhartha's announcement was followed by a long period of silence, and then the father responded,

> "It is not fitting for a brahmin to speak hard and angry words, yet in my heart I cannot accept this. Do not let this request cross your lips a second time." (pg 12)

However, Siddhartha responds in an unconventional manner, he stood in one place and stared into the distance for hours on end to prove the sincerity of his plight. This concept of peaceful protest was used often during the Indian Independence movement and its efficacy was again proven during the American Civil Rights movement. The protest moved his father and his response is a prime example of an alternative stance from staunch, dogmatic traditionalism.

> "You will go off to the forest," he said, "and become a shramana. If you find happiness in the forest, come back and teach me happiness. If it's disappointment you find, then come back and we shall again make sacrifices to the gods together." (pg. 13)

The father recognized that his son had reached a point of maturity and respected his son's autonomy and desire to seek the truth. He set his son free but ensured that he knew that he always had his family as a safety net.

### Reaction

Organized religion is important, even for those who leave it to seek a different truth or an alternative approach to improving themselves as people. It gives a solid spiritual foundation and ensures that they are somewhat in tune or at least aware of the generally accepted beliefs within their culture. This gives them the ability to express an appearance of orthodoxy and gives a common spiritual channel that they can interact with others through. 

Furthermore, I think the meaning of Govinda's quote regarding the "mindless good sheep in the common herd" requires careful interpretation else it may feel confrontational or accusatory.  Here, mindless does not imply dumb, these people may simply be untuned to matters of spirituality yet recognize the social value of "fitting" in a religious setting. Some people have different callings to their lives. Maybe they are interested in their trades, hobbies, or families. Not everyone is interested in spiritual truths about themselves and the universe. Sometimes churches and temples are social clubs where people build community and that is okay because that could be the whole point of organized religion and a major reason why it has thrived for so long.

Lastly, I do not believe that we should necessarily villainize the father for his initial reaction to his son's desire to leave the family religion. This was a major life decision that Siddartha was proposing, and I believe that it is good for a parent to challenge the resolve of their child before they undertake a major life journey. Once Siddhartha proved that his resolve was genuine, the father accepted the decision.

Regardless of these points, this was a fantastic chapter. I would be curious to read Hesse's own thoughts on the value of his upbringing in organized religion to his spiritual journey. The first chapter of the book did an excellent job briefly setting the stage, introducing the characters and their backstories, relaying their problems, and outlining the goal of the journey that they will take over the course of the novel. Although written in narrative form, the structure of this book so far feels like it was made transparent on purpose so that readers would be able to easily deduce the conclusions that the author intended to communicate.

## With the Shramanas

### An overview of Asceticism and Initial Thoughts

Asceticism is a concept that seems to be pervasive across different religions of the world. Most religions include some form of fasting or strenuous self-discipline to help focus the practitioner on higher purposes. I believe that asceticism has merit and that we use similar concepts in our day-to-day lives. Consider programming for example. When encountering a tough bug in software that needs to be identified and understood, a common tactic is to first create a *minimal reproducible example* by cutting out everything which is not necessary for the purpose of solving the problem in order to focus our efforts and quickly reach a solution. I believe that asceticism serves a similar purpose, stripping down life to a bare minimum in order to focus your efforts on a particular problem or goal.

However, our software analogy highlights a *temporary measure* -- once the bug is fixed, the minimal reproducible example is discarded and our changes are incorporated into our main program. I believe asceticism should be approached in a similar manner, as a temporary measure to help us identify changes that need to be made in our lives. Once the changes are identified and practiced enough, the ascetic period can end and normal life can resume enhanced with new learnings.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Shramanas" content="
Shramana seems to be a general term for a practitioner of an eastern religion who subscribes to a ascetic or austere lifestyle. Their religious beliefs appear to be extremely varied and it seems safe to equate Shramanas to the monks or penitents of Western culture."

### The Goal of Pursing Asceticism

Hesse thankfully continued to use logical and transparent structuring throughout the chapter. We are quickly provided with Siddhartha's goals in pursing asceticism, and are then provided with various discussions where Siddhartha expressed his disatisfaction with the practice before opting to leave it to pursue a different path.

> Sihharta has one single goal before him-- to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorry. To die away from himself, no longer be "I", to find the peace of an empty heart, to be open to wander within an egoless mind-- that was his goal. When every bit of ego was overcome and dead, when in his heart all cravings and compulsions had been stilled, then the ultimate must awaken, that innermost essence in one's being that is no longer ego, the great mystery (pg. 15).

Siddhartha wanted to being his journey in search of the Atman by first stripping his life of *himself*. This seems like a logical first course of action for seeking the Atman since it is purportedly separate from the ego. Maybe cleaning out the ego makes the Atman easier to encounter?

### Siddhartha's Observations on Asceticism

Siddhartha and Govinda excel at the ascetic path as much as they excelled in organized religion. They were respected by the elders of their sect and Govinda commented that Siddhartha would one day be venerated as one of the greatest practitioner of their belief. Siddhartha marked some incredible personal acheivements during his growth as an ascetic, yet began to question the teachings. For example, great teachers of asceticism have mastered their arts over the course of fifty plus years, yet none of them had attained nirvana.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Nirvana" content="
Not the band, but having now research the concept of Nirvana, the band name feels a bit more profound. Nirvana is the point where the individual is extinguished and replaced with a state of chief happiness where one is liberated from worldly suffering. This causes *samsara*, the cycle of rebirth, to be broken. One who attains Nirvana is set free from reality."
%}

Since ascetics appear to be unable to attain nirvana, the fruits of their labor are limited to a temporary discarding of the ego, something which Siddhartha lamented can be learned "in any tavern in the whore's quarter" (pg. 18). He then continued to explain that the temporary escapes resulting from the pursuit of asceticism are no different than the result of a hard night of drinking by someone who wants to "forget themselves" for a time. Frustrated that their success in the ways of asceticism caused them to come no nearer to the goal that they were seeking, Siddhartha and Govinda left the sect in search of a teacher who had reportedly attained Nirvana.

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Govinda" content="
Govinda's name appears to mean either *chief hersman* or *one who gives pleasure to the sense*, both of which feel unrelated to the story. Further exploration shows that there is a set of poems composed in 12th century India called the *Gita Govinda*. These describe the relationship between a few key gods and a group of female cowherders. So it is possible that Govinda represents the relationship between Siddhartha and society as a whole, with Govinda representing the greatest possible example of what friendship can offer."

### Reaction

Certain excepts of the account of Siddhartha's life as an ascetic appear similar to the life of someone with depression. Being "...empty of thirst, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow" (pg. 15) is particularly reminiscent of the numbed feeling. Maybe depression is the subconcious pulling one into an ascetic phase, demanding that they step back from life and deeply evaluate their situation before proceeding?

## Gotama

### First Impressions

Siddhartha and Govinda, feeling dissatisfied from their experiences as ascetics, embarked on a journey to meet a rumored Buddha by the name of Gotama, an individual who had purportedly attained enlightment. Govinda had met a trustworthy source who claimed to have met Gotama and vouched for his authenticity. Upon reaching the town where the Buddha resided, we learn that Gotama had formed quite a following and had taken up residence in a sort of pleasure garden donated by a wealthy businessman. A brief encounter with a townsperson gives us our first impression of Gotama:

> "I have seen the Exalted One many times. Many a day I have seen him passing through the streets, silent, in his yellow robe, holding out his alms bowl without speaking at the doors of the houses, and carrying his full bowl away" (pg. 29).

I am not sure how this passage would be interpretted by someone more familiar with eastern culture, but this did not leave a good first impression to me. In fact, it did quite the opposite, as it harkened forth images of grifters seeking to live a carefree life of luxury off of the toils of others. The scenes in the pleasure garden did little to assuage these concerns. However, our intrepid duo listened to a sermon delivered by Gotama and were thoroughly impressed. Even Siddhartha appeared to be completely enraptured.

> He (Siddhartha) was little interested in the teaching; he doubted it would contain anything new to him, since, like Govinda, he had repreatedly heard the content of this Buddhadharma, even if only second- or thirdhand. But he kept his eye attentively on the Buddha's head, his shoulders, his feet, on his still, loose hand; and it seemed to him that every joint on every finger of this hand was a teaching, that it spoke truth, breathed truth, smelled of truth, glowed with truth. This man, this Buddha, was in truth who he was even in the movements of his little fingers. This man was holy. Never had Siddhartha so venerated someone, never had he loved a person as he loved this one (pg. 31).

Gotama means *kind of poison* in Sanskrit. Fascinating!"

### What People Seek in Religion

This chapter also provided some interesting insights regarding religion. On page 32 we are given a very simple blueprint for religion: "LIfe was suffering, the world was full of suffering, but liberation from suffering had been found. He who followed the path of ____ attained liberation." This blueprint is very general yet feels broadly applicable to religions.

Siddhartha meets with Gotama to discuss the teachings and relate a perceived fatal flaw within them. Before discussing the flaw, Siddharta front loaded his discussion with high praise for the teacher,

> "Truly every brahmin's heart must beat faster in his breast when, through your teaching, he glimpses the world as a perfectly linked whole, without a break, clear as a crystal, *not dependent on anything random*, not dependent on the gods (pg. 36; emphasis added)."

In this quote we see another major motivation for religion, belief that the world, and therefore our lives, are ordered and deterministic. *Not dependent on the gods* indicates a deist point of view, a philosophy that was widespread in the West in the late 1700s but I do not know enough about eastern traditions to know if this is a widely held belief among their practicioners. This passage should come as no surpise, as determinism is comforting. In life we prefer to believe that hard work and good virtue will always lead to prosperity. Being 100% sure helps you plan ahead in life much more easily than being 50% sure.

However, Siddharta related his only concern about Gotama's teachings: although they were fantastic from a doctrinal point of view, they did not contain any information about Gotama's person enlightment. The people were there to learn about how Gotama reached nirvana yet Gotama was not telling them. For Siddharta this must have been very frustrating. He had dedicated his entire life to seeking nirvana, endured a brutal journey as an ascetic, and had managed to find someone who achieved enlightment-- only they could tell him neither what enlightment was nor how it was found.

At this point, Siddhartha revealed how it was that these teachings contradicted the goal of his journey. Siddhartha sought the abandonment of the ego and the discovery of the Atman, yet in Gotama's religious following Siddharta worried that he would abandon his ego only to replace it with a new ego-- community. Replacing one's ego with the ego of a community definitely fits the mold of transcendence, but it was not the level of transcendence that Siddharta was looking for.

{% include admonition.html type="er-note" title="Atman Continued" content="Now I think I understand what Atman is. Just as our cells, tissues, and organs transcend through unity and cooperation to form us, humans can transcend to form something greater. All things in the universe cooperating harmoniously with the aim of transcendence would be the greatest possible transcendence."
%}

### Siddharta's Formal Parting from Religion

Gotama represented an extreme case in the world of organized religion. He represented someone who was not only completely sound doctrinally but was also able to let the teachings fully permeate every fiber of his existence. He did not just talk the talk, he also walked the walk. Siddhartha was fortunate to experience the pinnacle of what organized religion could offer because it proved to him without a shadow of doubt that he needed to strike out and form his own conclusions.

## Awakening

In the final chapter of the first part of the novel, Sidhharta had an epiphany that changed the course of his journey. Frustrated about his lack of answers after exploring mulitple avenues of religious teachings, Siddhartha pondered:

> But now what is it that you were trying to learn from teachers and teachings, and what is it that they, though they taught you a lot, could not teach you? And he found this: It was the ego whose meaning and essence I wanted to learn. It was the ego that I wanted to get rid of, to overcome. But I was unable to overcome it, I could only trick it, could only elude it, could only hide from it. In truth, nothing in the world has occupied my thoughts so much as my ego, this enigma that I am alive, that I am unique and separate and distinct from all others, that I am Siddhartha! And there is nothing in the world I know less about than me, than Siddharta! (pg. 42)"

Siddhartha was seeking to understand himself so that he could leave himself, yet he was going to other people to try and learn about himself. Would not the leading expert on himself be, himself? 

> Oh, he thought, taking deep breaths, now I will not let Siddhartha slip away from me again! No more will the point of departure for my thinking and my life be atman and the suffering of the world. I will no longer kill myself and tear myself to pieces trying to find the secret beneath the rubble. ... I will learn from myself, be my own student. I will learn about myself, about the mystery of Siddhartha (pg. 43).

Here we have it, Siddharta had decided to shift his focus away from transcendence and the world around him and instead towards himself. Immediately, he began to see the world in a new light and experienced a feeling of awakening. However, he was immediately confronted with a daunting crisis, an intense wave of loneliness the likes of which he theorized had never been seen.

> Siddhartha continued to stand there motionless, and for the period of a heartbeat and a breath his heart went cold... when he realized how alone he was. For years he had been homeless and not felt it. Now he felt it... Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, ...spoke as he did. But he, Siddhartha, what was he part of? ... Whose speech could he speak? ... That was the last shudder of awakening, the last pang of birth. And immediately he resumed his journey, walking with haste and impatience, no longer back in the direction of home or father, not back anywhere (pg. 46). 

Siddharta was embarking on a deeply personal journey within himself. Because of this, his experiences and conclusions would only be decipherable by one person-- himself. There was now no body he could share his life with. There would be nobody who could understand him, not even his 
father.

### Reaction

This chapter was masterfully written and thus fantastic to read. The pitch, pace, and tone of the passage shifted throughout like a cleverly written muscial composition. I could almost hear Wagner playing in the background as I read through it. This encounter was similar to something that I experienced a few years ago.

There is one point, however, that I do disagree with. Deeply seeking more about yourself does not disbar you from sharing your findings with others. We all evolved similarly and we all have a common set of experiences and growth milestones in our lives. It is quite possible that any discovery made about ourselves will be both descipherable and useful to another. Yes, there may be some things that you learn which are true for yourself and not necessarily others, but even sharing these insights could prove useful to others. There are many organizations world wide, both religious and secular, who are dedicated to understanding ourselves and our place in the universe.

Regardless of any minor quibbles, this was a powerful privot point in the story.

## Final Thoughts

It is worth noting that at this point Hesse had to put down writing the novel. In the interim, he apparently endured a serious personal crisis. The introduction mentions that he was quoted stating, "I'm setting it aside for now, because I would have to depict a next phase of development that I have not fully experienced myself." This is *quite* the cliff hanger, and it also sets a major sense of expectation about part two. In part one, Hesse related a story that included encountering the pinnacle of religion, identifying its greatness, only to turn away to seek something more. Is he saying that Siddhartha's story is all his personal experience? *Is part two claiming to be the answer to all of these questions?*
