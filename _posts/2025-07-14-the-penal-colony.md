# In The Penal Colony
Collected Stories - Everyman's Library Edition 1993

## Summary
A servant is condemned to death in an unusual manner in a penal colony on an unnamed remote desert island. Through the eyes of an enlightened European explorer, we become witnesses of a gruesome quasi-religious practice being observed by its sole remaining adherents.

The four main characters in the story are the officer performing the execution, the condemned, the soldier guarding the condemned, and the explorer witnessing the proceedings. The two Commandants, the previous chief adminstrator of the island and the current, are other major characters who do not take part in the story directly but are frequently referred to and are key symbols in the narrative.

## Reaction
An enormous amount of meaning and connections can be drawn from this short tale. It is no wonder that this is considered one of Kafka's most influential works. There are a lot of thoughts about this work to unpack.

## The machine

The machine which carries out the gruesome death sentence is the focal point of the narrative. Nearly all of the story consists of descriptions of the machine or the officer discussing the machine. The officer idolizes and adores the machine that was once a major symbol and rallying point for the community. Although the explorer, and by extension us, clearly view it as a barbaric monstrosity, to the officer and his outmoded worldview, the machine is a device of wonder that brings together people of all ages to share in its spectacle.

The machine itself is described as a rube-goldberg machine with a grotesque appearance. Most notably, the chamber in which the gruesome proceedings take place is made out of glass so that observers may witness the proceedings. The profound amount of spikes and needles, the elongated and gangly description, and the prolonged proceedings of incredible pain remind me of the Shrike and its Tree of Pain in the sci-fi novel Dan Simmon's *Hyperion*. Additionally, the religious mysticism surrounding the device mirrors the religious Church of the Shrike.

Three main interpretations of the symbolism of the machine stand out to me.
- It could be seen as the symbol of the inhumanity of the then still dying era of Eurpoean imperialism
- It could be the symbol of a fading religion whose practices that we were once thought of as necessary and purifying were becoming vilified.
- It could be a satire about how anything could be industrialized and would be praised by society.

All of these interpretations involve multiple elements of the story which are tied together and surrounding the machine itself. In my mind, none of these three interpretations are mutually exclusive.

### The death of imperialism and the transition to modern morality

A few clues lead the reader to picture late-stage Victorian era imperialism. First of all, the story takes place on a penal colony on a remote desert island. An explorer is witnessing the world first hand. The officer wears militarist style formal wear and clings to backwards beliefs which hinge around a few people delivering dictatorial directives with no input from the people who are affected by them.

The Commandants themselves seem to signal the transition between the eras. The first Commandant ruled with an iron fist, did not interview accusees before dispensing justice, and made a sport of witnessing the executions. He seems to represent the absolutist and imperialist era in which the officer thrived.

The new Commandant was drastically different. The officer constantly lamented his progressive ideologies and particularly the influence of the ladies on him. The officer seemed to have a singular detestment of the ladies. We know that women's circles were major advocates for social consciousness in the Victorian era and their influence on their husbands in the male dominated political scene helped foster a transition to modern moralilty, particularly in the treatment of prisoners. 

One interpretation of the officer is that he represents individuals and organizations who specialized and thrived in one system of worldview but are left behind in the transition to a new one. People such as these are often tragic but interesting studies, such as the large homeless populations of eastern bloc countries following the fall of the USSR or the communal Australian aboriginis following the transition to a system of governance based on the ownership of personal property.

### The machine as a religion

Various descriptions of the machine and the officer evoke in the reader's mind the scenes of a dying religion. The machine is housed in a temple-like atmosphere which was once cherished and regularly attended by a congregation of all ages. The first Commandant was described as having many "adherents". The original designs for the machine are guarded by the officer as if they were sacred texts and are described as his most "prized possession". Indeed, at the end of the narrative, the explorer finds the original Commandant's grave, which is tucked away and ignored like a relic or monument from a forgotten religion but has an ominous warning about how the future, a final note that we will touch upon at the end of this entry.

### The machine as satire

This story was written in the early years of the 1900s, but a modern day reader may draw connections between the machine and the death camps of the 1940s Third Reich.

One possible interpretation of the machine is that it is a hyperbolized example of how to a certain segment of the population, anything can be mechanized or, in this day-and-age, scaled/productized, and be celebrated and praised by the wider community.

Kafka, who died in the 1920s likely never thought that this example of hyperbole would one day become a terrifying reality implemented at a unimaginable scale. A terrifying machine that he, because of his Jewish heritage, would have likely fallen victim to.

## The explorer
The European explorer passively witnessing while largely abstaining from affecting or passing judgement upon the proceedings of an as-of-yet undiscovered society is a common trope among utopian fiction from the Renaissance through the Enlightment period. Classics such as *Candide*, *Gulliver's Travels*, *the City of the Sun*, and Thomas More's *Utopia* all employ this narrative device. Kafka leans on this celebrated trope to paint a familiar picture for readers.

However, the sheer barbarity of the device nearly causes the explorer to depart from his perscribed role of passivity. He is often described as feeling extreme senses of revulsion and considers intervening on behalf of the condemned. At the conclusion of the story, he welcomes and aids in the officer's decision to become the machine's final victim. He finally flees from the island, and refuses to take with him the soldier and the condemned, threatening them with physical violence and not giving them a chance to plead their case. Perhaps he views them as irrevocably tainted by the evils of the penal colony.

## The soldier and the condemned

The condemned was sentenced for sleeping during his assignment as morning sentry at a minor officer's bedroom door. Even though the island is isolated and seemingly free of worries, this harsh sentence was delivered upon the accused. The condemned was never given a chance to plead his case.

Ironically, the solider that is assigned to guard him is caught doing the same exact thing that the condemned was! He fell asleep during the officer's exposition of the machine to the explorer. Even though his task was more meaningful than the condemn's sentry posting, he was not given any punishment.

Another interesting note is that the two characters are not given a single line of dialogue throughout the story.

## Notable Quotes/Passages

I rented this book from the library and thus could not highlight. I had some in mind but I have lost them. The story is short enough to say, the whole story.


## Connections

### Banality of Evil, Hannah Arendt

Parallels can be drawn between the officer and Adolf Eichmann, another industrialist who was called upon to optimize a machine that was meant for human destruction. Both Eichmann and the officer display an obsession in their professional pride and a complete loss of touch with reality and the moral implications of their career. 

### Hyperion, Dan Simmons

I mentioned parallels between the machine and this excellent sci-fi novel earlier in the entry.
