Hermann Hesse, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Ed., 1963

## Introduction

This novel has been a roller-coaster thus far, and there are many threads left unresolved. This section of the novel begins to fill in some details, and I have already leaned on some of the content of this section of the novel in the previous post. Thus far, we have learned what is means to be a Steppenwolf (and, to some extent, human). We have also learned how it was that Harry came to be a Steppenwolf and encountered a mystical woman by the name of Hermine.

Where will Harry's relationship with Hermine go? What is Harry's ultimate fate? Let's dive in.

## The Inevitability of Death

In the last post, we discussed how the far-right was beginning to tighten its grip around both the media and academia in inter-war Germany. In the novel, it became increasingly apparent that it was this political movement which ousted Harry from his cultured bourgeois lifestyle and set him on the path to becoming the Steppenwolf. It is understandable that many of Harry's desperate feelings are directed towards this movement. Hermine encountered an inflammatory article in which a radical pundit vilified Harry. Harry responded,

> Hermine, even though such abusive articles cannot annoy me any longer, they often sadden me all the same. Two-thirds of my countrymen read this kind of newspaper, read things written in this tone every morning and every night, are every day worked up and admonished and incited, and robbed of their peace of mind and better feelings by them, and the end and aim of it all is to have the war over again, the next war that draws nearer and nearer, and it will be a good deal more horrible than the last. ... There is no sense in thinking or saying or writing anything of human import, to bother one's head with thoughts of goodness- for two or three men who do that, there are thousands of papers, periodicals, speeches, meetings in public and in private, that make the opposite their daily endeavor and succeed in it too. (pg 117)

Hermine linked these words of defeat to the inevitability of death, a theme that appears to lie just beneath the surface throughout this novel,

> It is just the same as when a man is sad to think that one day, in spite of his utmost efforts to prevent it, he will inevitably die. The war against death, dear Harry, is always a beautiful, noble and wonderful and glorious thing, and so, it follows, is the war against war. But it is always hopeless and quixotic too. (pgs 117-118)

Harry retorted,

> That is perhaps true, but truths like that-- that we must all soon be dead and so it is all one and the same-- make the whole of life flat and stupid. Are we then to throw everything up and renounce the spirit altogether and all effort and all that is human and let ambition and money rule forever while we await the next mobilization over a glass of beer? (pg 118)

Hermine responded with a look of amusement. She once again defused a grave situation with humor!

> Remarkable the look that Hermine now gave me, a look full of amusement, full of irony and roguishness and fellow feeling, and at the same time so grave, so wise, so unfathomably serious. "You shan't do that... Your life will not be flat and dull even though you know that your war will never be victorious. It is far flatter, Harry, to fight for something good and ideal and to know all the time that you are bound to attain it. Are ideals attainable? Do we live to abolish death? No-- we live to fear it and then again to love it, and just for death's sake it is that our spark of life glows for an hour now and then so brightly." (pg 118)

This discussion was quite heavy, as are most discussions around inevitable misfortunes (death, taxes, social injustice, etc.). However, we do see humor at play once again, and it is becoming more evident that the use of humor to cope with the ills of reality is a key message in this novel. From this passage we can also glean a few kernels of wisdom. First off, political harmony is likely an unattainable ideal, just as eternal life is. However, we must not dismay. What good would it be to give up? Hermine argued that giving up would still lead to the same outcome as fighting would, yet our lives would instead be flat and without dimension. It is this fight for our ideals, and this fight against death, which gives flavor and meaning to life. Hermine argued that if we did not have the promise of death before us, then life would not have its moments of joy. There would be no reason to cling to life and enjoy its moments. This echos Hesse's messaging in Siddhartha where he argues that life is precious and inner peace is attained by living fully in the present because we are not guaranteed the blessing of life in the next moment.

## Hermine's True Intentions

At this point we should pause and discuss the nature of the relation between Harry and Hermine. Hermine is described as being in her early 20s while Harry is described as being 49, although his penchant for excessive drinking has aged him prematurely. The age of 49 is significant because very early on in the novel it was revealed that Harry had resolved to allow himself the decision to kill himself on his 50th birthday, a chance that he thus-far appeared most willing to take. Harry commented on the odd nature of their relationship and even attempted to downplay any romantic potential between the two of them due to the dead end that his life was rapidly approaching.

It is here that the enigma of Hermine intensified even more so. Hermine stated that her goal was to cause Harry to fall in love with her. However, after he would fall in love with her, she would request him to kill her. Talk about an enigma...

## The Relationship Continues

Harry's relationship with Hermine continued, and through it Harry began to acknowledge and foster other neglected selves within him. This began with dancing, which Harry had been so dogmatically opposed to in the Black Raven. However, at the behest of Hermine, Harry learned the foxtrot and began frequenting the dance halls with his new companion. Through a casual relationship with beautiful courtesan Maria, Harry also began to foster his erotic self, a side of him which had long been suppressed through guilt due to his bourgeois upbringing. Harry fostered his adventurous self through a friendship with the jazz musician Pablo, who expanded his musical palette with jazz and his recreational palette through the consumption of new and exciting drugs. As a whole, Harry's life began to look something like the free love movement of the 1960s, a possible reason why the band Steppenwolf cited this novel as being so foundational to their music.

The fostering of these new selves allowed Harry to see reality with different perspectives. His relationships with his new friends even caused his distaste of consumerism, a core value to the bourgeois, to be called into question. After buying a gaudy and out-of-fashion handbag as a gift for Maria, a well intentioned gesture by a man so infant in the ways of love, Harry considered,

> Before all else I learned that these playthings were not mere idle trifles invented by manufacturers and dealers for the purposes of gain. They were, on the contrary, a little or, rather, a big world, authoritative and beautiful, many sided, containing a multiplicity of things all of which had the one and only aim of serving love, refining the senses, giving life to the dead world around us, endowing it in a magical way with the new instruments of love, from powder and scent to the dancing show, from ring to cigarette case, from waist-buckle to handbag. This bag was no bag, this purse no purse, flowers no flowers, the fan no fan. All were the plastic material of love, of magic and delight. Each was a messenger, a smuggler, a weapon, a battle cry. (pgs 143-144)

All of this frivolity and living in the moment had caused Hermine's odd request to become a distant memory.

## The Globe Rooms

Hermine obligated Harry to attend a masked ball at the Globe Rooms. Harry appeared to drag his feet somewhat, as he decided to go to his usual dive bar and spend several hours there before heading to the Globe Rooms late into the night. Once there, he was overwhelmed by the dense throng of party-goers. The Globe Rooms were packed with hundreds of dancers and each room had its own bands. He searched many hours for any signs of his friends, but to no avail. The wolf within him was threatening to resurge. Then, as he was about to checkout his coat from the coat room, a message was delivered to him,

> Tonight at the Magic Theater. For Madmen Only. Price of Admittance your Mind. Not for Everybody. Hermine is in Hell. (pg 164)

It looks like we may soon get a taste of what the magic theater is all about. As an aside, hell in this case is a quaint term used to describe the basement bar at the Globe Rooms. When Harry reached the basement, it was just as packed as the rest of the venue, but there was an available spot in the bar next to somebody who looked oddly reminiscent of his old friend Herman. After sitting by him, Harry realized that it was Hermine dressed in drag! He had finally found Hermine, but the high quality of her drag bound them by social convention to not display any affection for each other. Remember, this was the 1920s. Instead, they passed the night away in a friendly competition in which they attempted to woo the same women. Hermine definitely won that competition.

The party continued to a feverish crescendo all the way into the morning. Harry had completely lost himself in the orgy of sight, music, and dancing. But then something transfixed his gaze,

> And then of a sudden I saw, half coming to my senses for a moment ... I saw a black Pierrette with a face painted white. She was fresh and charming, the only masked figure left and a bewitching apparition that I had never in the whole course of the night seen before. While everyone else the late hour showed itself in flushed and heated faces, crushed dresses, limp collars, and crumpled ruffs, the black Pierrette stood there fresh and neat with her white face beneath her mask... I bent down to kiss her mouth as we danced. Its smile was triumphant and long familiar. Of a sudden I recognized the firm chin, the shoulders, arms and hands. It was Hermine, Herman no longer. (pgs.170-171)

The elaborate trap had been set and snared, and love is the tender trap.

## Parting Thoughts

Harry is now clearly in love with Hermine. Will she now ask him to kill her? Will we see the Magic Theater? Harry's 50th birthday should be coming soon as well. Will he choose to end his life?
