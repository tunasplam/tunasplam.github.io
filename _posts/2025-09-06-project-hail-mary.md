Andy Weir, Ballantine Books, 2021

## Summary

Because of the nature of how this novel is written, I am going to avoid giving as many spoilers as possible. Therefore, this post will be rather short. However, I do not think it spoils much, given the title and what we know about the author and his other much more famous work The Martian, to say that this novel is a near-term hard science fiction work in which the Earth faces an impending extinction event. Here I use the phrase near-term to indicate that this is set in a world that is nearly indistinguishable from Earth in the early 21st century, but it is sci-fi because, well, space and rocket ships and whatnot.

The reason why I am so hesitant to give any spoilers is because the story itself starts with an amnesia event. Because of this, the main character of the story is piecing together what is transpiring through the novel at the same pace as we are. This results in a delightful and well written story.

## Reaction

As I said before, this book was delightful. The author plays out the amnesia situation very well, and leans on a lot of really neat science in doing so. One of the reasons why I was so thrilled about the amnesia introduction is because a major stumbling block for fantasy and sci-fi novels is a "ramp up period" where the reader must become familiar with a world which is drastically different from that of their own. Because of this, the first couple of chapters of these novels either feel slow in pace or are filled with details and references that are completely foreign to the reader. However, the amnesia intro coupled with a familiar and contemporary world allows the author to throw the reader directly into the climax of the novel while not worrying about story-specific details mystifying readers because when these details arise both the reader and the protagonist are learning about the "for the first time."

Because of the heavy emphasis on science, the novel will likely feel more accessible to space enthusiasts who have been exposed to high school level physics, chemistry, and biology. Programmers especially may find this read enjoyable, as Weir's former career was software engineering and several adages and common themes from the profession find their way into this story. If you are a die hard Star Trek fan but lament the constant usage of scientific "black boxes", then this novel is definitely for you.

## Connections

I am sure that there are a lot of similarities between this novel and the Martian, so I will likely want to read that book at some point. Otherwise, the heavy amounts of speculative science fiction balanced by attempts to be grounded in science is reminiscent of Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars* trilogy. *The Expanse* novels also come to mind, although that series is definitely a bit more of a space opera. Any fans of the scientific elements of this story should also check out PBS's YouTube series *Spacetime*. I would also recommend the works of Scalzi to people who enjoyed this novel.
