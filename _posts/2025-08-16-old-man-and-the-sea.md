Ernest Hemingway, Book-of-the-Month Club, 1993
Originally Published 1952

## Introduction

According to my very brief research on the subject, this novel appears to have mixed opinions. Although this book was cited as a major factor in Hemingway's winning the Nobel Peace Prize in literature, won the Pulitzer prize, and initially received a warm public reception, public interest in the novel waned in the years following its release and now experts appear divided in their opinion over it with some questioning whether it was truly Nobel- and Pulitzer-worthy. Regardless, I have thus far read two other Hemingway novels, *The Sun Also Rises* and *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, and thoroughly enjoyed them, so this novel has been high up on my list for some time.

## Overall Thoughts

This was a fantastic novel and upon close reading it contains multiple facets that could easily appeal to many different types of people. On the surface, it presented itself as a macho tale about deep sea fishing and the struggle for survival against circumstance and the elements, but the novel also bore respect for the creatures of nature, nostalgia for a time that is now lost, a veneration of the sea, and gave us a rare glimpse into a culture and way of life that is completely foreign to most readers. Hemingway's writing style gave the novel a feel akin to a long form documentary where the reader's internal voice transitioned seamlessly between the direct thoughts and observations of the fisherman and the voice of a documentary narrator.

## Specific Thoughts

Although this novel was short, there were several key thoughts which jumped out to me.

### Mirages

The story begins by introducing an old fisherman and a boy. The boy lives with his parents and makes a living as a ship-hand and assistant to fishermen who brave the deep seas around Havana in search of Marlin and other large fish. The old man lives in a shanty that barely fits a makeshift bed of newspaper, a tiny table, a stool, and the detachable mast of his tiny skiff.

The boy has been prohibited by his parents from serving on the old man's ship, as it is now widely believed that the old man is chronically unlucky because of his recent stretch of misfortune on the seas. However, the boy, motivated by compassion and some sort of feeling of attachment to the old man, continues to assist the old man in whatever ways he can onshore, including helping him set up his boat, providing him bait fish, and sourcing him charity sustenance.

Through the conversation between the two, we learn that the old man has gone eight-four consecutive days without a catch, which is likely the majority of the fishing season. It is implied later in the story that the fishermen must make enough earnings in the fishing season to sustain themselves throughout the winter and it was already growing late in the year. The situation appeared bleak, but the old man and the boy stayed positive by speaking in certain terms about a future that was unlikely to come to be. This is an important detail of their relationship that will aid us in interpreting the ending of this novel.

### The Timelessness of Baseball

One topic that frequently surfaces as a "distraction from reality" throughout the novel is baseball. As I am mildly obsessed with the sport, I feel that commentary on this topic is obligatory. The old man and the boy talk about the Yankees and the (then Brooklyn) Dodgers, their struggles to reach the postseason, and Joe DiMaggio playing through a bone spur injury. Joe DiMaggio is mentioned so frequently throughout the story that he feels almost worthy of being considered a character, and we will expound more on Joe DiMaggio's role in the narrative later on. I found this passage to be particularly comical:

> "The Yankees cannot lose."

> "But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."

> "Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio."

> "I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland."

> "Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago." (pg 17)

Baseball is so cool. It has a rich history, is the right mixture of predictability and unpredictability, and has delivered myriads of tantalizing and surprising narratives over the decades. The sport feels timeless, and some things about it feel as if they might never change, such as the White Sox and Reds being mired in mediocrity (my condolences if you are a fan of either franchise).

### A Lost Art

Deep sea fishing is not what it used to be. The art related in this narrative is an intensely physical and grueling ordeal that is only practiced and mastered by the very poorest. An adventure seeker from a developed nation my eschew modern technology to experience deep sea fishing in its most simple and strenuous form but the level of expertise and hardened physicality developed by the old man is something that is only found in poverty. The old man represented a dying breed in the Carribean and the United States.

### The Cost of Hyper-fixation on a Goal

I am fresh off of the heels of a deep dive into Hesse's *Siddhartha* and I feel I will be absorbing the novel for quite some time. For this section, reading my writeup on the aforementioned novel may help provide context. In *Siddhartha* one of the keys to breaking away from samsara and finding peace is to not pursue a goal and be truly present and enjoy life at every moment. By following these principles, *Siddhartha* obtains enlightenment.

This novel represents the exact opposite of this teaching. Here we see the story of a man who is so fixated on achieving his goal that he shreds any hope of finding peace or enjoyment in life. The man's thoughts are constantly preoccupied with the future, his concerns about it, and his need to catch the big fish. Although he lives a life at a beach front resort and works amid the serene backdrop of the deep sea surrounded by fascinating life, he dogmatically tears himself away from being *present* and enjoying life in order to focus wholeheartedly on his goal. This seems crazy, especially considering he is not even guaranteed to catch a big fish!

This entire novel felt like a stern warning about the life of someone who dedicates themselves wholly to the pursuit a goal, a life driven by the sunk cost fallacy and constant feelings of coming so close yet falling just short.

And even if one does achieve their goal, what worth is it if they die doing so, or sell their soul in the process? The fisherman does indeed catch his fish, but afterwards he continued to observe that he had strayed too far from the shore in order to do so. There were many problems, the first of which being that the fish was much larger than the boat itself, so the only way he could transport it back to port was to strap it to the side of his skiff. However, the marlin needed to be harpooned as the final *coupe d'grace*, yet this wound caused blood to spill into the water, eventually attracting sharks. The old man had a harpoon, but the harpoon was only effective in killing sharks which had already taken hold of the fish and were tearing meat off. The process of doing so would cause more blood to spill into the ocean, thereby attracting more sharks. The prized marlin was guaranteed to be picked clean before the old man reached port.

From the very beginning of the struggle, the fisherman had doubts about whether to continue pursuing the big fish on his line, but the sunk cost fallacy had already set in. He even cut loose a line that had taken bait in order to focus completely on the big fish on his line.

The sharks do eventually pick the marlin clean, and the fisherman is forced to see his crowning achievement wither away before his very eyes. He had strayed too far and the pursuit of his goal with reckless abandon led to a desperation that led to poor decision making.

### Joe DiMaggio's Bone Spur

The bone spur in particular brought up some interesting questions to the old man: what is a bone spur? What would it feel like? And is it something that the members of the old man's community experience without feeling the need to identify it?

I think that these questions invite us to consider the similarities between the old man and professional baseball players. Both live lives of singular focus on their craft, baseball players dedicate years developing niche skills to try and give them marginal advantages over an incredibly competitive field and deep sea fisherman dedicate years of practice in search of insight and skills that give them an advantage against the vast expanse of the sea and its denizens.

As discussed earlier, the old man fixated much more on his goal of catching the "big fish" than the average deep sea fisherman. He aspired to the pinnacle of his craft just as many professional baseball players aspire to win a World Series. And just as the best deep sea fishermen in the world are still not guaranteed to catch a record breaking fish, so too are the greatest baseball players not guaranteed a World Series ring (Mike Trout likely understands this all too well).

Furthermore, not all deep sea fisherman are cut from the same cloth. Many are like the old man--impoverished and honing their craft because it is what they need to do to survive. Others are formed from more luxurious backgrounds and pursue the craft out of passion rather than necessity. Likewise, many baseball players pursue the craft to elevate themselves and their families out of impoverished situations, wheres many others pursue the craft because the fortunate circumstances of their upbringing enabled them to pursue their passions. Joe DiMaggio's father was supposedly a fisherman, a point that I feel is further invitation by Hemingway for us to compare the two professions.

There is one last peculiar similarity shared by both professions that I would like to touch upon: there are much easier alternative ways to earn a living. An aging deep sea fisherman or one struggling to get by could likely find work in a cannery or as a laborer. Likewise, a career minor leaguer can almost certainly acquire a higher standard of living by applying their work ethic and life skills to pursing a different career. Yet many decide to stay despite their circumstances and the alternatives, and it is likely the passion or way of life that causes them to do so. The same could be said for novelists and this is a thread that we will tug on later in this essay.

In fact, I believe that the messages of this novel could be generalized to many different professions or paths of life.

### The Death of the Fisherman

The fisherman eventually hauled the skeleton to shore in the dead of the night and stumbled into his bed. The other fishermen awoke in the morning and stared  in wonder at the skeleton of the glorious marlin, but they also dreaded what it meant about the beloved old man. The boy went to the old man's bedside and swore that he will fish with the man from that point onward. They discussed plans of going out fishing the next day. Unfortunately, this was yet another example of the purposefully wishful thinking that we encountered at the beginning of the novel, suggesting that the old man instead passes in his sleep.

### The Analogy to Hemingway's Life

This piece is considered semi-autobiographical, with several proposing that the old man and the search for the big fish is an analogy for Hemingway's career as a journalist and author and his search for respect for his work. It is ironic that this novel itself ended up being Hemingway's "big fish" as it won the Pulitzer prize and was highlighted in the rationale behind the decision to give him the Nobel Peace prize.

He committed suicide later in his life due to the unbearable and life changing pain that a couple of plane crashes inflicted upon him.

### The Lions?

There are also frequent mentions to how the old man used to dream a variety of different dreams, but now his dreams consisted only of lions that he once saw resting along the shores of Africa. They were the final dreams he witnessed before his death as well. The meaning of these lions completely eludes me. Maybe one day I will reread this novel and it will make sense.
