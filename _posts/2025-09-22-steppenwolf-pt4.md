Hermann Hesse, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Ed., 1963

## Introduction

Harry, the enigmatic Steppenwolf, engaged in friendship with the even more enigmatic Hermine, a mysterious young lady whose wisdom and worldliness belies her years. Hermine had already ominously declared her intentions-- to force Harry to fall in love with her only for her to request to kill him. Their relationship progressed smoothly and, through it, Harry built up several more friendships, each nurturing a once neglected self within him. This all culminated with the mad party of the Globe Rooms, during the crescendo of which Hermine reveals her true womanly figure to Harry, enticing him to finally fall madly in love with her. What will come next?

## Magic Theater - For Madmen Only!

After the party had ended, Pablo invited Harry and Hermine (hey, these names are like Harry Potter! Probably coincidental) into the back to partake in the magic theater. The two were completely exhausted from the festivities of the night, but Pablo had a curative ready-- a remedy which set the tone for the finale of the novel.

> From a recess in the wall he took three glasses and a quaint little bottle, also a small oriental box inlaid with differently colored woods. He filled the three glasses from the bottle and taking three long thin yellow cigarettes from the box and a box of matches from the pocket of his silk jacket he gave us a light. And now we all slowly smoked the cigarettes whose smoke was as thick as incense, leaning back in our chairs and slowly sipping the aromatic liquid whose strange taste was so utterly unfamiliar. Its effect was immeasurably enlivening and delightful-- as though one were filled with gas and had no longer any gravity. Thus we sat peacefully exhaling small puffs and taking little sips at our glasses, while every moment we felt ourselves growing lighter and more serene. (pgs. 174-175)

### The Prerequisite

From this point onward things began to get weird. As the opening passage suggested, the magic theater is a complete trip. Harry was given some instructions,

> This little theater of mine has as many doors into as many boxes as you please, ... and behind each door exactly what you seek awaits you ... but it would be quite useless for you to go through it as you are. You would be checked and blinded at every turn by what you are pleased to call your personality. You have no doubt guessed long since that the conquest of time and the escape from reality, or however else it may be that you choose to describe you longing, means simply the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality. ...  You are therefore requested to lay these spectacles aside and to be so kind as to leave your highly esteemed personality herein the cloakroom where you will find it again when you wish. (pg 176)

In order to fully experience the magic theater, Harry must leave his ego at the door. This is an interesting twist on a classic adage! In this case, Harry must abandon his adopted perceptions and the lens with which he views reality so that he may interpret the going-ons of the magic theater with an open mind. This escape from the ego is a common pursuit among people who try to "lose themselves" or "fully immerse" in whatever it is they are doing, whether it be from reading a book, watching a show, playing a video game, drinking at the bar; "living in the moment", argues Hesse, is ultimately aimed at relieving oneself of themselves. This argument is also mirrored in Siddhartha.

### The Purpose of the Magic Theater

Now Pablo turned to the purpose behind that early morning's delights,

> Now, Harry, come along, be as jolly as you can. To make is so and to teach you to laugh is the whole aim of getting up this entertainment-- I hope you will make it easy for me. (pg 175)

Pablo set up the Magic Theater in order to teach Harry how to laugh, knowing full well that humor is the key to coming to terms with the tortured existence of the Steppenwolf. How did he know this? Because it was apparently Pablo who had orchestrated the whole novel! It was he who endeavored to deliver the *Treatise on the Steppenwolf* to Harry. At every turn, Pablo himself is employing humor, indicating that he likely has learned to manage the multiple selves within him.

But how was Harry to leave his ego at the door? Pablo explained,

> You will now erase this superfluous reflection, my dear friend. That is all that is necessary. To do so, it will suffice that you greet it, if your mood permits, with a hearty laugh. You are here in a school of humor. You are to learn to laugh. Now, true humor begins when a man ceases to take himself seriously. (pg 175)

Harry must learn to not take himself so seriously and learn to laugh at himself. This feels like wisdom. How many times through this novel have we seen Hermine defuse one of Harry's spirals with an appeal to humor? This is something that we could employ in our lives as well. When identifying a personal spiral because of the bruised ego, laugh at it and yourself! Maybe that will help you shift perspectives and de-escalate the situation.

Pablo gave Harry some parting words before sending him into the circus,

> I wish you good riddance of the Steppenwolf for today at any rate. For naturally, your suicide is not a final one. (pg 178)

So this seems to answer one unresolved question. We have been pondering whether Harry would find his end with a final, physical suicide, or if he would end it with the metaphorical ego-killing suicide that heralds the awakening of a genius. By teaching him humor and the ability to laugh at himself, Pablo was aiming to direct Harry towards the metaphorical suicide, and that is likely what Harry will end up doing.

## Jolly Hunting - Great Hunt in Automobiles

Harry decided to enter in a door titled "Jolly Hunting - Great Hunt in Automobiles. That sounds pleasant, maybe a hunting trip through the Serengeti? Wrong! Upon entering the box, Harry encounters what could best be described as scenes from World War II. Everywhere, soldiers, armored cars, and planes wage war against an armed peasantry. Through the events which transpire behind this door, we discuss two competing philosophies as interpreted by two very different types of people. But in the end, both are rejected as dogma, and dogmatic thought itself is refuted.

### The Two Sides of the Conflict

Upon entering the doorway and witnessing the carnage within, Harry contemplated the propaganda posters on the walls of the shelled buildings,

> On every wall were wild and magnificently stirring placards, whose giant letters flamed like torches, summoning the nation to side with the men against the machines, to make an end at the last of the fat and well-dressed and perfumed plutocrats who used machines to squeeze the fact from other men's bodies... Set factories afire at last! Make a little room on the crippled earth! Depopulate it so that the grass may grow again, and woods, meadows, heather, stream and moor return to this world of dust and concrete. (pg 180)

This was the message of the revolutionaries, a group of people who appeared to be some sort of radical Luddite eco-anarchists who were seeking to bring about the end of capitalism and industrialization. Let's have a look at the other side,

> Other placards, on the other hand, in wonderful colors and magnificently phrased, warned all those who had a stake in the country and some share of prudence (in more moderate and less childish terms which testified to the remarkable cleverness and intellect of those who had composed them) against the rising tide of anarchy. They depicted in a truly impressive way the blessings of order and work and property and education and justice, and praised machinery as the last and most sublime invention of the human mind. With its aid, men would be equal to the gods. (pg 180-181)

So the other end of the conflict was the established order of the day-- a society which was attempting to progress and transcend their base nature. This appeared to be a classic conflict between pathos and logos.

> The flaming eloquence affected me as powerfully as the compelling logic. They were right, and I stood as deeply convinced in front of one as in front of the other... (pg 181)

But which side to choose?

### A New Character Emerges

In the fury of the fighting, Harry encountered another friend from his youth, this time a school mate by the name of Gustav. We learn that Gustav had gone on the become a professor of theology, which is very interesting because this was a completely different path of life than the secular career which Harry had chosen. We have an interesting scenario where we have two extremely dissimilar individuals evaluating two ends of a conflict. Gustav immediately proffered his thoughts on his background,

> There you are again, you idiot, jabbering and asking questions. I'm a professor of theology if you want to know. But, the Lord be raised, there's no occasion for theology now, my boy. It's war. Come on! (pg. 181)

After this exclamation, Gustav took a page out of Grand Theft Auto by murdering a driver and stealing their car. That is quite the radical departure from the lifestyle of a theologian. When asked about his opinion on the war, Gustav responded,

> Oh, Lord, that's a matter of taste, so we can leave it out of account-- though now you mention it, I rather think we might take the other side [the anarchists], since at bottom it's all the same. I'm a theologian and my predecessor, Luther, took the side of the princes and plutocrats against the peasants. So now we'll establish the balance a little. (pg. 182)

This is unexpected. An apocalyptic revolution on the scale of the Russian Revolution was proceeding around him, and Gustav had not bothered to formulate an opinion on the matter. Furthermore, once mildly pressed on the subject, it only took him a mere moment to choose a side, and he did so whimsically through an appeal to humor!

World War I was a terrible event for theologians, and many did not survive it. Even if they physically survived the ordeal of the Great War, it effectively killed their faith and thus their way of life. But here we see Gustav confronted with the same faith-shattering ordeal yet being able to seemingly wave it off and adopt a completely new mindset-- all with the aid of humor.

### On the Nature of Duty

The two of them took on the life of a brigand and posted themselves in a position along a roadway where they ambushed motorists and destroyed their cars. At one point, they accosted the automobile of a public prosecutor and press him about his career. The prosecutor responded that he sought the condemnation of people because it was the duty of office, just as it is the duty of the office of the brigand to kill people. This elicited a response from Gustav,

> The perception of duty is certainly unknown to me-- now. Formerly I had a great deal of official concern with it. I was a professor of theology. Besides that, I was a soldier and went through the war. What seemed to me to be duty and what the authorities and my superior officers from time to time enjoined upon me was by no means good. I would rather have done the opposite. But grating that the conception of duty is no longer known to me, I still know the conception of guilt-- perhaps they are the same thing. In so far as a mother bore me, I am guilty. I am condemned to live. I am obliged to belong to a state, to serve as a soldier, to kill and to pay taxes for armaments. And now at this moment the guilt of life has brought me once more to the necessity of killing the people as it did in the war. And this time I have no repugnance. I am resigned to the guilt. I have no objection to the stupid congested world going to bits. I am glad to help and glad to perish with it. (pgs 185-186)

There are many motivators to actions. Often we appeal to duty and responsibility, but it is also common for society to employ both shame and guilt to mold individuals or force them into action. Gustav is correct in the sense that both duty and guilt can be used for the same purpose, so in this case they can be seen as one in the same.

We also see an indirect reference to the doctrine of original sin. Here we see a slight alteration of the doctrine though. In the Bible, the doctrine of original sin suggests that one is born into a sinful existence and thus sin is unavoidable. Here however Gustav appears to be suggesting that sin is instead brought forced onto people by the state in order to guilt them into conformity. That is certainly an anarchist argument if I have ever seen one.

### The Verdict on Dogma

These scenes play out so often in life-- two sides of an argument that are so dedicated to their beliefs as a whole that they are unable to recognize the similar points of their beliefs and thus reconcile with a compromise, or at least admit that they are wrong when new evidence comes which calls their beliefs into question or even when it simply demands slight adjustments. This is *especially* the case whenever religion, or any other set of beliefs precipitated on too many core, inviolable beliefs, are appealed to-- or when somebody's wallet is threatened.

Harry had been uncharacteristically mum throughout this spectacle, but he finally delivered his thoughts on the matter,

> What we are doing is probably mad, and probably it is good and necessary all the same. It is not a good thing when man overstrains his reason and tries to reduce to rational order matters that are not susceptible of rational treatment. Then there arise ideals such as those of the Americans or of the Bolsheviks. Both are extraordinarily rational, and both lead to a frightful oppression and impoverishment of life, because they simplify it so crudely. (pg 188)

The problem with dogmatic beliefs is that they must be viewed as correct and that they must be simple enough for people to understand. There is nothing wrong with adopting a simple model of understanding, even if it is slightly inaccurate, but it is imperative to always be willing to adjust your model of understanding when evidence becomes overwhelmingly contrary.

If you are a practitioner of dogma, it is unwise to "reduce to rational order matters that are not susceptible of rational treatment" for two chief reasons. Firstly, what if at some point society begins to understand a concept which once eluded rational treatment and your beliefs were found to be wrong? This would call the entirety of your beliefs into question. Secondly, If your interpretation of the unknown is at odds with another's interpretation of the unknown, and you both cling to those beliefs as inviolable, then that will inevitably lead to conflict.

Lastly, the unfortunate reality of life is that some concepts are simply too complex for people to understand. It is not that they are incapable of understanding, that is a dangerous path of reasoning to tread down, people often times do not care enough to devote the time and resources to truly understand something which they believe does not really affect them. I believe that there are several highly controversial policies today which fall under that same boat, such as the state giving clean needles to heroine addicts or schools giving contraceptives to teenagers. Both are lambasted frequently on the streets, in the bars, at the water cooler, in the churches, and in the media, yet people who rail against the policies do not take the time to sit down and try to understand why these policies came about in the first place. And when someone tells them about the public health benefits and overall alleviation of strain on our already bursting medical system these policies provide, they do not actually care. It is quite possible that they do not even care that the policies are being enacted in the first place, they simply want something to focus their complaints on. And that in itself is not something that should be decried either because we all have complaints and we all want to get them out on something; the more trivial the better. How many people complain about the performance of their sports teams? It is an issue which reasonably cannot be fixed by the complainer, but it is certainly better than getting worked up about something *significant* which cannot be fixed by the complainer. If we complain about something which we are fully capable solving, then we may be bound by guilt to begin contributing to a solution, and that may be inconvenient.

All that to say, when society wishes to push dogmatic beliefs on the general populace, it understands all too well that the general person is not going to care enough to take the time to understand complex concepts. Thus the dogma must be simplified and summaries such as the Ten Commandments, the Bill of Rights, and the Pillars of Islam must be given to the people. The simplifying summaries can not possibly hope to cover all specific scenarios and edge cases, and this often leads to confusion, misinterpretation, and-- more conflict (see the first amendment especially, it seems like encountering somebody who does not understand either the breadth or the limitations of the freedom of speech is a daily occurrence).

### A Word of Caution

I can easily see how this section of the story could be taken out of the larger context of the novel and misused. We must remember the words of Hesse in the preface when he warned about using this book in its narrative form as dogma and remember that one of the central messages behind both this section and other works by Hesse is the rejection of dogmatic beliefs. Unfortunately, many in the 1960s, most famously the Manson family, took this and similar eco-anarchic ideologies way too far.

The interpretation of this passage is another case study of how humor can defuse a potentially dangerous situation. To paraphrase an explanation from a friend of mine, when we read authors like Hesse and Nietzsche, we must remember that much of their work is just a guy getting drunk or high and spewing a bunch of bullshit. There is a bit of wisdom in works such as the Steppenwolf, but we must remember to not take works such as these too seriously and be able to sit back and laugh a little at the absurdity of the novel and the absurdities in life that it points out.

## The Wisdom of Multiple Selves

After stepping out from the chaos of the previous room, Harry entered into a room where a swami, with a mysterious resemblance to Pablo, provided us with a concise summary of the notions of the multiplicity of self which were presented throughout the novel.

> The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that man consists ofa multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity may be dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding and lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. (pg 192)

This appears to claim that science has difficulty dealing with the notion of the multiplicity of the souls because it is not possible to cleanly partition one's existence into the different selves. There is no way to analyze a person and attribute a specific trait or action to a particular self within them. The interplay and manifestations of the selves are chaotic and thus unable to be categorized and easily predicted.

> This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal,and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses.

Some are able to thrive in the artificial world of the unified self, although they would be considered insane from the point of view of someone aware of the multiple selves. Likewise, many eminent geniuses are considered crazed due to society's inability to recognize or accept the multiple selves within them.

> Hence it is that we supplement the imperfect psychology of science by the conception that we call the art of building up the soul. We demonstrate that to anyone whose soul has fallen to pieces that he can rearrange these pieces of the pervious self in what order he pleases,a nd so attain to an endless multiplicity of moves in the game of life. As the playwright shapes a drama from a handful of characters, so do we from the pieces of the disintegrated self build up ever new groups, with ever new interplay and suspense, and new situations that are eternally inexhaustible. (pg 192)

And here we have an interesting take away from the notion of the multiplicity of the selves. Once one has identified the fact that there are more than one personalities within them, and have come to terms with their disorderly nature, hopefully through the application of humor, then that person can harness the multiple selves to construct unique personas which can be used in a variety of applications to help serve their needs. This is quite useful! It reminds me a lot of the philosophy behind the Shin Megami Tensei *Persona* game series, where the players are encouraged to see their personalities (or personas) as masks which can be interchanged to best suit the social situation that they find themselves in.

## Conclusion

From this point until the end of the story, the acid trip intensified greatly. Harry revisits the circumstances of his first childhood crush, and then continued on to experience once more every romantic encounter he had ever had. There was a bizarre and gorey instance of a man taming a wolf as a circus master would do so with a lion, only for them to trade places and for the wolf to then train the man. Then there was an exceedingly bizarre situation where Harry entered into the cold realm of the immortals and had an encounter with a completely bonkers manifestation of Mozart.

This all culminated with Harry coming across Hermine lying with Pablo. Harry took a knife and used it to kill Hermine. Pablo had a surprisingly cool response to the occasion, but Harry was put onto trial and executed none-the-less. The verdict?

> "Gentlemen, there stands before you Harry Haller, accused and found guilty of the willful misuse of our Magic Theater. Haller has not alone insulted the majesty of art in that he confounded our beautiful picture gallery with so-called reality and stabbed to death the reflection of a girl with the reflection of a knife; he has in addition displayed the intention of using our theater as a mechanism of suicide and shown himself devoid of humor. Wherefore we condemn Haller to eternal life and we suspend for twelve hours his permit to enter our theater. The penalty also of being laughed out of court may not be remitted. Gentlemen, all together, one-two-three!" (pg 215)

Strange, but at least Harry did not *actually* kill Hermine and that all of that was a giant metaphor... for something... so that is a relief. Also, it appears that Harry has obtained the status as an immortal (he is, after all, immortalized in this novel). But I think the most interesting thing here is that he had taken the Magic Theater too seriously, and maybe that explains Pablo's unnaturally cool response to witnessing the murder of Hermine, he himself was not taking things too seriously. The Magic Theater is supposed to be humorous. Humor is the key for unifying the soul and helping people cope with the insanity of reality. But humor, like any belief which can be turned dogmatic, can be taken too seriously or used in the wrong way.

## Final Takeaways

This novel took much longer for me to get through than I had initially thought. It was uncommonly difficult to understand and I feel that I likely missed many key points or references, yet still was able to extract quite a bit of meaning from the text and the ending served to neatly wrap up many questions which lingered throughout the novel. What stood out the most though are three key points:

- The idea of a unified ego is a social construct. People have within them multiple selves and their personality cannot be cleanly partitioned among them and their actions can not be simply explained using them. However, people can harness these selves to create personas at will which serve their needs.

- Dogmatic beliefs are dangerous.

- Humor is very powerful. It is a powerful coping technique, a healing agent, and can unite even the most diametrically opposed of movements. If you cannot take a step back and laugh at yourself and the circumstances of the world around you then you are fated to have a miserable existence.

I hope you enjoyed this dive into Steppenwolf.
