Hermann Hesse, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Ed., 1963

## Introduction

### Motivation

I read Siddhartha recently and it was a great book. The novel was excellently structured and presented a fresh perspective on life and spirituality. The main ideas were relatively easy to extract and the story invited a lot of discussion. I had originally intended to do only one entry about it, but it morphed into two rather hefty long-form entries. Hesse ended off Siddhartha laying out a couple of intriguing principles for living a life of peace, and my main motivation for jumping into Steppenwolf, which was written a few years afterwards, is to see how consistent Hesse was with his messaging between the two novels.

Out of Hesse's novels, Steppenwolf is the one I have heard the most about in passing, but I have not heard much detail so I feel I am going into this read a bit blind. And there was a band named Steppenwolf, right? A quick internet search shows that yes there was indeed, and the band drew their name from this novel. Some of their songs are quite identifiable, and I wonder how much of their works are influenced by this novel, so I may give them a listen sometime soon.

Aside from the consistency in messaging, I am also curious to see if Hesse continues to use the same writing style that I adored so much in Siddhartha of if he writes this novel with a different approach.

I decided to write this post while at page 64 in my edition of the novel, so the contents of this entry are *not* reflective of the novel as a whole but rather my initial impression of it.

### Hesse's Style and Connections to other Novels

It became quickly apparent that Hesse did *not* employ the same writing style in this novel as he did in Siddhartha. In the preface we are introduced to a character known as the Steppenwolf by a nephew of the lady that the Steppenwolf boards with. The preface is written from the point of view of someone who uncovered the Steppenwolf's personal memoirs and are about to relate their absurd contents to the world. The tone feels almost as if we are watching a true crime or a mystery documentary. In fact, this style should seem familiar to people who have read gothic horror as the "journal/memoir/collection of first hand accounts" style is a common theme among novels such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The enigma of the Steppenwolf also evokes memories of the enigmatic male figure in Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.

Once the perspective of the novel switches to that of the Steppenwolf, the tone becomes much more prosaic and intensely gothic, which feels a bit out of place considering the novel was penned in 1927 and thus is a bit more modern than whats traditionally considered the heydey of gothic romantic literature, but the "out of place" tone fits with the story quite well for reasons we shall soon see.

## Who (or What) is the Steppenwolf?

In the preface, Hesse set forth the question that we will be exploring through this entry: Who or What is the Steppenwolf?

{% include admonition.html type="names-note" title="Steppenwolf" content="
Since the meaning of the names in Siddhartha ended being so important to the interpretation of the story, it is likely that Hesse may have strategically chosen some names in this novel as well. We are told early on that he is a man by the name of Harry Haller, but that name does not tell us anything obvious. *Steppenwolf* is German for wolf from the steppes but is probably better translated as coyote. After getting a bit of the ways through the novel, \"lone coyote\" feels right."

Through the eyes of the flatmate the Steppenwolf is initially described to us as an unconventional intellectual, but it is worth noting that the flatmate had only interacted with the subject of this tale a few times in passing and was only relating a shallow impression.

> He gave at the very first glance the impression of a significant, an uncommon, and unusually gifted man. His face was intellectual, and the abnormally delicate and mobile play of his features reflected a soul of extremely emotional and unusually delicate sensibility... He had thought more than other men, and in matters of the intellect he had that calm objectivity, that certainty of thought and knowledge, such as only really intellectual men have, who have no axe to grind, who never wish to shine, or to talk others down, or to appear always in the right. (pg. 8)

But then the flatmate invited the Steppenwolf to attend a seminar delivered by an esteemed intellectual, and during the beginning the Steppenwolf delivered a glance which communicated,

> "See what monkeys we are! Look, such is man!" and at once all renown, all intelligence, all the attainments of the spirit, all progress towards the sublime, the great and the enduring in man fell away and became a monkey's trick! (pg 9)

This came at the tail end of a description of the glance that spanned nearly an entire page. It is clear to us that whatever the Steppenwolf is, he is insightful. I will also like to comment that these two observations stand in stark contrast to one another and so far I believe that duality will be a major theme in this story.

### Speculation on his Mental Health and Upbringing

To the flatmate, the Steppenwolf (henceforth HH for his name Henry Haller) appeared ill in character and disposition and someone who one would naturally shy away from. He further speculated that this ailment was a result of his sharp intellectual cynicism.

> I suspected that the man was ailing, ailing in the spirit in some way, or in his temperament or character, and I shrank from him with the instinct of the healthy... In the course of time I was more and more conscious, too, that this affliction was not due to any defects of nature, but rather to a profusion of gits and powers which had not attained to harmony... I saw at the same time that the root of his pessimism was not world-contempt but self-contempt; for however mercilessly he might annihilate institutions and persons in his talk he never spared himself. (pgs 10-11)

HH appears to be a cynic, skeptic, and a critic but the person that he is the most critical of is himself. Thus far he appears very aloof and separate from humanity. Here is some speculation on his upbringing.

> Although I know very little of the Steppenwolf's life, I have all the same good reason to suppose that he was brought up by devoted but severe and very pious parents and teachers in accordance with that doctrine that makes the breaking of the will the corner-stone of education and upbringing. But in this case the attempt to destroy the personality and to break the will did not succeed... they succeeded only in teaching him to hate himself. (pg. 11)

Siddhartha had an autobiographical vein running throughout the story as it related somewhat to Hesse's personal spiritual journeys. Hesse was raised in a family that had multiple generations of renowned Christian missionaries, so it is possible that here we see some of Hesse's life reflected in HH.

Next we are rendered a description of HH's quarters and the phrase **artistic disorder** stands out as an apt description of both his dwelling and what we know about HH so far.

### The Steppenwolf is a... Romantic?

At one point something happens that flies in the face with what we know about the Steppenwolf so far- he apparently has a love interest! We are shown very little about the situation and are revealed only that he has a photo of her in his room, that she called upon him once and they went out briefly before he returned in a downtrodden mood, and that the flatmate once saw them walking arm-and-arm down the street one time. This man is very enigmatic, and the enigma of the main character feels par for the course in a romantic gothic novel.

### The Flatmate's Diagnosis

At the end of the preface, the flatmate introduced HH's personal memoirs, which we will soon dive into. In his closing remarks, the flatmate touched upon what appears to be his diagnosis of the Steppenwolf. He delivers this commentary regarding the memoirs:

> I see them as a document of the times, for Haller's sickness of the soul, as I now know, is not the eccentricity of a single individual, but the sickness of the times themselves, the neurosis of that generation to which Haller belongs. (pg 21)

He then related a remark of Haller's:

> "...Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence. Naturally, every one does not feel this equally strongly. A nature such as Nietzsche's had to suffer our present ills more than a generation in advance. What he had to go through alone and misunderstood, thousands suffer today. (pg 22)"

From what I have gleaned in future passages, "not of a single individual" is a good hint at some of the issues revealed to us in HH's memoirs. We also see that the flatmate diagnosed the Steppenwolf as a man out of his time. Someone who belonged to another generation. But which generation? The intensely prosaic and gothic tone of HH's memoirs seem to suggest that he is a romantic from the early 19th century being forced to live in a culture which was increasingly becoming sanitized by capitalism and the institutions of business and trade. HH's complex relationship with the bourgeois is hinted at in the preface and explained in much more detail early on in the memoirs.

The preface contained several references to Nietzsche and I cannot help but wonder if I am missing a lot of meaning from this novel by having not read Nietzsche yet. There was a passage in the preface that reminded me of some raft analogy that I had heard secondhand, but I must confess that I am not familiar enough with it to draw any connections. One day I will get around to his works.
