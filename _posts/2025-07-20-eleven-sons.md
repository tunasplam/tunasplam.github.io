# Eleven Sons
Collected Stories - Everyman's Library Edition 1993

## Summary
A man is describing to us his eleven sons. The description of each of these sons is an excellent one-paragraph character sketch so this work has somewhat of an "artist's sketchbook" feel to it where we see Kafka flexing his literary skills in a short format setting. The composition of the story feels very musical. The tone of the story begins with a procession of phrases, a distinct crescendo, and then falls into a chilling diminuendo.

## Reaction

The man describes his sons in a very clinical and critical fashion. He describes them not as a loving father but as a critical creator measuring the quality of brood. There appears to be a distinct emotional trajectory throughout the story where the son's become more distant/disdainful. The description of each son is briefly touched upon below. 

1. This son is given a very terse and disappointed description. There is not much to describe but he does infact use the term "love" although in the same sentence he states "as I love all of my sons" which, as we see in the text, is not love in the sense that we would understand it to be.
2. The second gets a very detailed explanation that gives the sense that the father is in fact impressed with him. But there is a specific detail and mannerism about him that the father describes as "...a kind of stray poison in the blood, a kind of inability to develop to the full of potentialities of his nature which I alone can see" (p. 186). Harsh words oozing with disappointment.
3. The description of this son indicates that the father is appreciative of some of his features but there are still issues that cause him to reject him from the "limelight". The descriptions still indicate that this son is part of his life and near at hand. The descriptions also seem to indicate that the son is depressed.
4. The fourth description is a clever little passage. The passage is crafted to mirror the father's beliefs about him. The description begins very glowingly and seems to crescendo higher and higher until it suddenly falls flat into flat disapproval. The passage ends with "He is like a man who makes a wonderful take-off from the ground, cleaves the air like a swallow, and after all comes down helplessly in a desert waste, a nothing. Such reflections gall me when I look at him." (pg. 186).
5. "My fifth son is kind and good; promised less than he performed..." Here is a clue that the father indeed formed preconceptions of how his son's would "perform" according to his standards. From there, the description only gets more disdainful. It is interesting that this son does appear to be one of the more successful of the sons according to the world and, likely, to the son's own standards.
6. The description of the sixth son implies that he is mentally ill and has some sort of developmental disorder that is physically apparent. The father does not use a disappointed tone at all in the this description, he merely describes the son and expects the reader to find the son disappointing without any assistance from the descriptor.
7. The seventh son stands in stark contracst to the other ten. The father is incredibly adulant in his description, even though the son is described to be somewhat of a failure in the eyes of the world. We see that he has a self absorbtion that the father admits to having (and yet deplores). The only disappointment that the father has towards him is that he appears to be asexual and thus will not reproduce and pass on his traits. This is a worst case scenario for a breeder. The creation of a perfect, yet sterile, speciment.
8. The distance between the father and the sons now becomes more palpable, almost as if the seventh son was the peak of a crescendo but is now being followed by a plummet into diminuendo. This son is depressed (the father hilariously has no idea why). This son has completely shunned his father. The father indicates that he wishes he could "call him back" to analyse him to classify him but admits that the distance between them is now too great.
9. The ninth is considered beautiful by the standards of the world and possesses charm, but appears to be indolent, slovenly, and vapid.
10. The tenth is supposed to be an insincere character. I shall not entirely deny or conifrm this supposition" (pg. 189). The tone of the description of the tenth son stands out amidst the others because of the jealous nature of its phrasing. This son also appears to be quite successful, but in a way that the father appears to be jealous of. 
11. The description of the final son represents the somber notes of the composition's diminuendo. The description describes the son as resolute, but implies that the resolution is one of a suicidal, and perhaps homicidal, nature. He would like to take his father with him.

## Notable Quotes/Passages

> Sometimes he looks at me as if he would say: 'I shall take you with me, Father'. Then I think: 'You would be the last person I would trust myself to.' And again his look seems to say: 'Then let me be at least the last.'
> These are my eleven sons (p. 189).

This is the conclusion of the composition. The father's opus ultimum is not only his greatest failure but could prove be the cause of his destruction.

## Connections

Given that this story seems to have a musical tone to it, I asked ChatGPT for piano solo compositions that mirror the tone of the story.

### Prompt

> which classical compositions by piano soloists do you think mirror the tone of this narrative?

### Repsonse

Great question! The tone of Kafka’s “Eleven Sons” — with its clinical, emotionally fraught, and ultimately chilling progression from tentative hope to alienation and collapse — can be beautifully echoed in certain solo piano works that explore complex, introspective, and sometimes unsettling emotional landscapes.

Here are some classical piano solo pieces that might mirror the narrative’s tone and emotional arc:

1. Frédéric Chopin – Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23
This piece moves from lyrical, hopeful themes into dramatic and turbulent passages, embodying tension and emotional conflict that mirrors the father’s oscillation between admiration and disappointment.

2. Franz Schubert – Impromptu in G-flat major, Op. 90 No. 3 (D. 899)
The melancholic, introspective mood and subtle undercurrents of sadness align with the quiet despair and emotional distance in the later sons.

3. Sergei Rachmaninoff – Prelude in B minor, Op. 32 No. 10
Dark, brooding, and at times violent, this prelude captures feelings of internal struggle and emotional turbulence akin to the father’s growing alienation and fear.

4. Alexander Scriabin – Prelude Op. 11 No. 4
This short piece conveys a haunting, mystical atmosphere with an unsettling undercurrent, reflecting the eerie and enigmatic qualities of the final sons.

5. Ludwig van Beethoven – Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor, Op. 111
Particularly the second movement, the Arietta, offers a profound emotional journey from struggle to transcendence, with moments of fragility and hope giving way to a transcendent but somber conclusion — echoing the narrative’s emotional trajectory.
