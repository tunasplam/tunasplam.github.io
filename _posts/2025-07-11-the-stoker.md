# The Stoker
Collected Stories - Everyman's Library Edition 1993

## Summary
A 16 year old German is cast off from his family for being seduced by one of the servants. The incident itself suggested coercion or abuse, though the story leaves the precise details ambiguous. He arrives to America, but a lifetime of adventure transpires before he even disembarks from the ship. This pleasant short story consists of two expertly crafted dialogues as seen through the eyes the insightful and clever young man.

## Reaction
The dialogue was great, the descriptions were vivid, and the story as a whole was a pleasant read. The ending was somewhat suprising, but it may have something to do with Kafka hyperbolizing the opportunity that America presents, perhaps somewhat ironically, as if he is mocking those who hype the prospects of emmigration to America. The story felt as if it had slight satirical undertones.

## Notable Quotes/Passages

> They certainly did not notice the holes that could be picked in that fine speech. Why, for instance, had the first relevant word that ocurred to him been 'dishonesty'? Should he have been accused of that, perhaps instead of nationalistic prejudice? A maid in the kitchen had seen the soker on his way to the office, and Schubal had immediately divined what that meant? Wasn't it his consciousness of guilt that had sharpended his apprehension? And he had immediately collected witnesses. had he, and then called them unprejudiced and incorruptible to boot? Imposture, nothing but imposture! (pg 60)

This was supposed to be a 16 year old boy, but his insight into this man (and others throughout the story) belies his years.

## Connections

Having visited Ellis Island museum and New York harbor in general made it much easier to slip into this narrative. If I recall correctly, Ken Burns had a good Ellis Island documentary that might be a fun correlarry to this story.
