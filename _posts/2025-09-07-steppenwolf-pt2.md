Hermann Hesse, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Ed., 1963

## Introduction

In both the preface and the first part of this story we explored the question "who and what is the Steppenwolf." If you have not done so, please read those first. We were able to answer that question so in this second section we will continue on in the novel while asking "what's next?" Will Harry force a confrontation between the two halves within himself and either revert to being a plain bourgeois or transcend to become a genius? Or will the depths of his despair drive him to suicide?

The preface of the novel sketched out a roadmap for the story. First we learned about Harry Haller, then a female is supposed to enter into the picture followed by some wild oscillations in Harry's moods. This all is supposed to conclude with Harry's disappearance.

As a note, this novel does not have clean division, so I will continue to make my own sections whenever I feel that I have enough content to write about.

## A Poem

Immediately after the conclusion of the Treatise on the Steppenwolf, Harry related a poem which he had written about himself in attempt to capture his struggles into writing. The poem itself indicated that the core of Harry's loneliness is the loss of his mate (his wife had kicked him out of his home and divorced him) coupled with his inability to find a new mate. This, combined with what we know about Harry's encounters with a female from the preface, seems to signal that now the story may shift to center around Harry's relationship with a woman.

Immediately following the poem we get a crash course on Harry's origin story. It consisted of a dramatic fall from normal society into the bohemian world of the Steppenwolf. At every step he lost friends, family, and further distanced himself from his past life and professional career.

So we are left with two questions: the first being "will Harry find a mate?" and the second being a bit more complicated. Harry appears to be destined to some form of suicide. His end will either come from suicide of the flesh, suicide of the Steppenwolf and the adoption of a model of a unified soul, or suicide of the notion of the unified soul (the ego) and the adoption of the panoply of selves within him. We are also clued in that humor will likely play a major role should this transformation into a genius be successful. So, which end will Harry come to?

## An Evening with an Old Friend

This new section started off with the Steppenwolf partaking in a random funeral procession and commenting on its absurdity. The overall tone of Harry's thoughts during the procession were sardonic, and the whole affair was reminiscent of an episode of Wednesday Addams. This ended up being serendipitous for Harry though, as at the funeral he encountered who he believes to be the same doorman which bestowed onto him the revelatory pamphlet on the Steppenwolf. Harry attempted to learn about the Magic Theater, and was instead told to seek out a bar/dance hall later in the evening.

Harry was disappointed by the encounter with who he believed to be the doorman, but he ran across as professor with whom he had once had a professional relationship. The two of them evidently discussed Eastern religion and philosophy to great extent, and the professor invited Harry to dine with him and his wife in their home. This dinner party will serve as a case study for the behavior of the Steppenwolf and the analysis of it will be the primary content of this post.

## The Dinner Party

The dinner party which followed rendered us a concrete example in which we observe the Steppenwolf's duality in full swing. The human side of Harry, which had been neglected of late because of his wolfish tendencies, was rusty. He even commented that talking itself had become laborious and foreign to him because of his isolation. The dinner party was proceeding awkwardly, and an air of premonition and foreboding sat over the whole affair; culminating in a deranged outburst which heralded the coming of a wolf. Very gothic!

But the object which elicited the outburst was most peculiar. It was a portrait of the poet Goethe, a painting which drew Harry's derision immediately upon entering the home. Most notably, he detested the self-surety of Goethe's expression within the portrait, something that we will comment on later in this discussion.

Things had not gone well in the dining room, and later, after the tensions of the dinner reached full boil, the company retired to the drawing room and Harry encountered the portrait's mocking gaze once again.

> "Let us hope," said I [Harry], "that Goethe did not really look like this. This conceited air of nobility, the great man ogling the distinguished company, and beneath the manly exterior what a world of charming sentimentality! Certainly, there is much to be said against him. I have a good deal against this venerable pomposity myself. But to represent him like this- no, that is going too far. [pg. 81]

The wife of the professor heard all of this, and the portrait of Goethe was her most prized possession. The encounter that resulted was brief but furious. This egregious social faux pas silenced the man within Harry and ushered forth the wolf. In a fugue, Harry rambled through the moonlight streets for hours, doing everything he could to avoid his quarters and the suicide he would likely attempt therein.

## The Black Raven

As his fervor began to abate, Harry decided to seek out the Black Raven. It is here that Harry encountered a most enchanting woman. The woman transfixes him and does her best to rouse him from his fugue. She sought to console him, fed him, gave him drink, yet he met everything with melancholic melodrama. At one point she extended an invitation to dance,and his refusal resulted in a confrontation which defines the next stage of this novel.

### Confronting Harry about his Actions

It is now that Harry's actions go on trial and he is asked to account for all of his crimes against good social company, the first being the debacle at the dinner party, particularly the incident with the Goethe portrait. His most recent crime consisted of his megalomaniac, some may say *ego*tistical, first impression on the fair lady who had spent her night out on the town feeding, consoling, and encouraging him- yet he had not even asked for her name. Instead, the entirety of the conversation focused on his misfortune. Now the conversation had turned to the incident with the Goethe portrait. The lady offered her analysis of the matter,

> Goethe has been dead a hundred years, and you're very fond of him, and you have a wonderful picture in your head of what he must have looked like, and you have the right to, I suppose. But the artist who adores Goethe too, and makes a picture of him, has no right to do it, nor the professor either, nor anybody else- because you don't like it. You find it intolerable. You have to be insulting and leave the house. If you had sense, you would laugh at the artist and the professor-laugh and be done with it. If you were out of your senses, you'd smash the picture in their faces. But as you're only a little baby, you run home and want to hang yourself. I've understood your story very well, Harry. It's a funny story. You make me laugh. [pg. 91]

Oh wow, humor! Here, it comes up twice, once as a suggestion of what Harry should have done, and another time being used by the woman. Is she signalling to him that she was once of is a Steppenwolf and understands how to employ humor in order to survive in society? Maybe this is the mate foreshadowed in the poem!

She also talked about Goethe. Harry admitted that Goethe had his failings, but overall what he was most upset about was that someone else did not agree with his idealization of the poet. This is an example of an ego so caught up in itself that it feels threatened when someone does not share his idealizations about something which the two of them have little to no personal experience with. We will continue to pull on the Goethe thread later in the post.

This response was a little too much for the woman. She responded,

> Then I'll tell you something. For an hour I've been saying 'thou' to you and you have been saying 'you' to me. Always Latin and Greek, always as complicated as possible. When a girl addresses you intimately and she isn't disagreeable to you, then you should address her in the same way. So now you've learned something. And secondly- for half an hour I've known you're called Harry. I know it because I asked you. But you don't care to know my name." [pg. 92]

The first sentence is likely somewhat lost in the translation between German to English as German has a formal tense which English does not. From this, we can surmise that Harry had likely been using the familiar *du* whereas the woman had been using the formal *Sie*. This goes to show just how egotistic Harry was behaving! Not to mention that several hours of deep conversation had passed at this point and he had not even bothered to ask for her name. Desperately, Harry attempted to reach out to her,

> "You're too late! If we meet again, you can ask me again. Today I shan't tell you. And now I'm going to dance. [pg. 92]

Exasperated, Harry begged that she come back to him after the dancing. She agreed, doing so with laughter (she's using humor again!), and in her absence Harry fell asleep.

## The Dream

In his slumber, Harry had a little dream. This dream is *weird*. So far this whole novel has been somewhat of an acid trip, which explains a bit of why it has been so difficult to interpret, but this dream definitely kicked things up a notch. Often times in novels and movies, dreams are idealized as some extremely lucid experience with clear narratives, messaging, and interpretations. Yet here Hesse does a masterful job describing the strange reality that are dreams.

> I dreamed that I was waiting in an old-fashioned anteroom. At first I knew no more than that my audience was with some Excellency or other. Then it came to me that it was Goethe who was to receive me. Unfortunately I was not there quite on a personal call. I was a reporter, and this worried me a great deal and I could not understand how the devil I had got into such a fix. Besides this, I was upset by a scorpion that I had seen a moment before trying to climb up my leg. I had shaken myself free of the black crawling beast, but I did not know where it had got to next and did not dare make a grab after it. [pg. 93]

Is this not how dreams actually are? Weird, disconnected gobbly-gook wrapped by a bizarre narrative spurred by sudden epiphanies. Harry is then ushered in to meet with Goethe, and between them a verbal engagement ensued.

### The Encounter with Goethe

This is where the acid trip seriously intensified, and the whole of the dream from this point on was rather difficult for me to wrap my head around. For me, this section only left me with more questions than answers. For one, why was Harry so upset with the portrait looking the way it was and why was he so antagonistic towards the Goethe in his dreams, though he admits in other parts of the story that he adored the works of Goethe.

Throughout the story, a tenuous relationship between Harry and the bourgeois is suggested. However, the real conflict appears to be between Harry and the increased tide of jingoism, nationalism, and war mongering that was taking hold of his country. Every establishment from the press to academia appeared to be gripped by this hysteria. Both Harry and Hermine, who we later learn is the name of Harry's potential doe, lament that it was this same attitude that led their nation into the horrors of World War I, and that it would be this same movement that brought it into World War II (this novel was written in the inter-war period, but Hermann Hesse was hardly the only person to read the writing on the wall regarding the coming of World War II at this point in the mid 20s). We later learn that it was this radical political movement that cast Harry from his career and sent him careening on his path to becoming the Steppenwolf.

The professor that he met with before heading to the Black Raven was a part of the academic wing of this radical political movement, and his wife was undoubtedly supportive of the cause. Her idealization of Goethe and Goethe's distinct Germanic identity made him a cultural focal point for the radical right. This perversion of one of Harry's favorite poets by the hands of his most hated adversaries was likely the cause of his extreme ire. To him, the warped portrait of Goethe, and the warped manifestation of him in the dream, likely epitomized the far-right's ill-fated perversion of German culture, academia, the press, and society.

## Closing Thoughts

We have now discovered what it means to be a Steppenwolf and have discovered a new person who, in all likelihood, is themselves a Steppenwolf of considerable more maturity. There are yet several lingering questions in this novel. What will Harry's fate be: will he ascend to become on of the "Immortals" or will his loneliness and temperamental moods drive him to commit physical suicide. Is Hermine really a Steppenwolf? What will come of their relationship?

Lastly, names were important in Siddhartha, but thus far they have not seemed as important. Harry is a childish name, something which Hermine directs our attention to in this section, implying that Harry is still immature despite his worldly knowledge, but that is the extent of the meaning of names thus far. However, here we encounter the somewhat hermaphroditic *Hermine*, who reminds Harry of *Herman*, a childhood friend of Harry's. We know the author's name to be *Hermann*, so I wonder if there is some connection here.
