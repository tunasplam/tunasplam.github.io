Hermann Hesse, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Ed., 1963

There is a preface. Read that article before reading this one.

## Introduction

In the last article we began by asking the question "Who (or What) is the Steppenwolf". The preface was penned from the point of view of a flatmate of the Steppenwolf who, after a couple drive-by encounters with the subject of this novel, related to us his impression of the enigmatic character. He reveals that the Steppenwolf, henceforth HH after his name Harry Haller, had left under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind his memoirs, the reading of which being the next stage of the novel.

Through this post, we will begin with examining HH himself, but then use these insights generalize other types of Steppenwolf's and extend these generalizations in order to postulate about humans in general. This section of the novel felt particularly prosaic, not very linear in its arguments, and thus not very straightforward to analyze, so I endeavored to cut out many parts which were worthy of discussion in order to try and focus on the main idea of this article.

Let's start by looking at how HH describes himself.

## How Harry Haller Describes Himself

We get a cursory introduction to the Steppenwolf through the eyes of Harry Haller. He likes to be surrounded by the placid orderliness of the bourgeois but often vacillates severely between this restraint and hedonism/sensuality. This oscillation between two states dominates his reality and thus will dominate the discussion throughout this post.

> But the worst of it is that it is just this contentment that I cannot endure. After a short time it fills me with irrepressible hatred and nausea. In desperation I have to escape and throw myself on the road to pleasure, or if that cannot be, on the road to pain. (pg. 27)

We also see another echo of the "man out of his own time" sentiment which was put forth in the closing remarks of the preface.

> I am in truth the Steppenwolf that I often call myself; that beast astray who finds neither home nor joy nor nourishment in a world that is strange and incomprehensible to him. (pg. 31)

## Treatise on the Steppenwolf

While in one of his hedonist fugues, HH encountered a mysterious doorway with mystic writing which read,

> Magic Theater. Entrance Not for Everybody. For Madmen Only!

Curious, he tried the door, but found that it would not budge. He passed on but later encountered a signpost with the inscription,

> Anarchist evening entertainment. Magic Theater. Entrance not for everybody.

To someone seeking to indulge the senses, these advertisement must have been very enticing! Excitedly, he asked the doorman for more information, but the doorman responded by mechanically handing HH a small book which we later learn is the *Treatise on the Steppenwolf. Not for Everybody*.

### The Steppenwolf Generalized

The treatise reads like some sort of intensely philosophic nature documentary, but it answers a lot of questions about the nature of the Steppenwolf. It reveals to us that the struggle of the Steppenwolf is that they have identified two halves to their soul-- the man and the beast. The two are always at odds at each other, and the Steppenwolf desires nothing more than to rid himself of one half or the other and become completely "whole". However, this is not possible, for in trying to rid himself of one side or the other, the Steppenwolf will inevitably discover that there is no clean delineation between the wolf and the man and cannot cleanly assign every one of their attributes, thoughts or actions among the two categories. The treatise generalizes these concepts for us:

> There are a good many people of the same kind as Harry. Man artists are of his kind. These persons all have two souls, two beings within them. There is God and the devil within them... and in just such a state of enmity and entanglement towards and within each other as were the wolf and man in Harry. And these men, for whom life has no repose, live at times in their rare moments of happiness with such strength and indescribable beauty...  their lives are not their own and have no form... To such men the desperate and horrible thought has come that perhaps the whole of human life is but a bad joke... however, the other thought has come that man is perhaps not merely a half-rational animal but a child of the gods and destined to immortality. (pgs. 44-45)

So we see that in general a Steppenwolf is someone who has some sort of duality within their nature and this reality can drive them to great highs but also dark lows. It sort of sounds like manic depression to me. This quote is an excellent introduction as to where this article is going. "To such men the desperate and horrible thought has come that perhaps the whole of human life is but a bad joke..." foreshadows a discussion about how humor is used to cope with the complexities of life. "...perhaps not merely a half-rational animal but a child of the gods and destined to immortality" foreshadows, in a rather flowery and sensationalist manner, that becoming a Steppenwolf, or rather coming face-to-face with the reality that one is a Steppenwolf is but the first step toward a journey that could result in transcendence to genius.

Unfortunately, this dual nature within him caused HH to feel *different* from others, so he sought out independence. However, his independence caused him to walk a path which altered him so much that he struggled to connect with others and thus his independence became, "his wish no longer, nor his aim ...  but rather his lot and sentence (pg. 46)." People were still friendly with him, but these people did so out of a stance of sympathy rather than friendliness.

### Humor is the Key to Harmony

A brief discussion on humor followed, and Hesse put forth some high praise of the attribute:

> Humor alone, that magnificent discovery of those who are cut short in their calling to the highest endeavor, those who falling short of tragedy are yet as rich in gifts as in affliction, humor alone (perhaps the most inborn and brilliant achievement of the spirit) attains to the impossible and brings every aspect of human existence within the rays of its prism. (pg. 55)

Here, I believe that the context of "the highest endeavor" is the pursuit of a religious/spiritual existence, as indicated by the context of the quote. "...those who falling short of tragedy are yet as rich in gifts as in affliction," suggests that Hesse is referring to humanity's tendency to make light of dark trials through humor. It is interesting that he considers humor to be both innate and a pinnacle of the human spirit, and indeed humor is often seen as a 'release valve' for pent up stress. Furthermore, in the eyes of a comedian, nothing is sacred, as humor, "brings every aspect of human existence within the rays of its prism." Hesse takes it another step further:

> To live in the world as though it were not the world, to respect the law and yet to stand above it, to have possessions as though "one possessed nothing," to renounce as if there was no renunciation, all of these favorite and often formulated propositions of an exalted worldly wisdom, it is in the power of humor alone to make efficacious. (pg. 55)

To me, this seems to indicate that one of the many positive aspects of humor is the ability to change one's perspective. This quote also imparts a sense of flexibility and fluidity, which are common themes in many wisdom proverbs. But why is humor relevant for the Steppenwolf?

> To attain this [possibly referring to "attain some sort of peace within themselves"], ... a Steppenwolf must once have a good look at himself. He must look deeply into the chaos of his own soul and plumb its depths. The riddle of his existence would then be revealed to him at once in all its changelessness, and it would be impossible for him ever after to escape first from the hell of the flesh to the comforts of a sentimental philosophy and then back to the blind orgy of his wolfishness. Man and wolf would then be compelled to recognise one another without the masks of false feeling and to look one another straight in the eye. Then they would either explode and separate forever, and there would be no more Steppenwolf, or else they would come to terms in the dawning light of humor. (pg. 55-56)

So in order for a Steppenwolf to achieve peace they must first force their dual selves to become fully aware of one another (or maybe they must fully accept and begin to analyze the duality of their nature)? From this encounter there are two possible outcomes: the first being the rejection of the dual nature, possibly resulting in a transition to becoming a functioning member of society, or they must learn to cope with their dual nature through humor. Humor is notoriously multi-faceted so it is not entirely clear how exactly humor is used to cause this reconciliation within a Steppenwolf, but humor is often considered 'disarming' and can be used to de-escalate a situation, so perhaps that is one of the ways in which humor is meant to be employed to the benefit of a Steppenwolf. Whenever they have escalating internal struggles or rising conflicts with others, they can use humor to de-escalate the situation.

### But why stop at Two Parts of the Soul?

Within the treatise, Hesse also gave some insights into suicide and its various forms as well as a few points regarding the Steppenwolf's tenuous relationship with the bourgeois, but I feel that this article would be better served by narrowing our focus down onto the soul of the Steppenwolf because some of the points presented by that line of reasoning fascinated me. I will pause to comment that the Steppenwolf's relationship with the bourgeois is interesting because the text appears to suggest that they are defined by their differences from one another, meaning that one cannot be without the other. The theme of duality is starting to recur in this text.

We saw earlier that the general Steppenwolf struggles because of a dual nature within themselves, but it is later suggested that duality itself is not present within nature but is instead a simplification that humans use to reason about the world. This leads to some profound conjectures about the nature of the Steppenwolf and about humans in general.

> For the close of our study there is left one last fiction, a fundamental delusion to make clear. ... If I say "above" or "below," that is already a statement that requires explanation, since an above and a below only exists in thought, only as abstractions. The world itself knows nothing about above and below. So too, to come to the point, is the Steppenwolf a fiction. When Harry feels himself to be a were-wolf, and chooses to consist of two hostile and opposed beings, he is merely availing himself of a mythological simplification. He is no were-wolf at all, and if we appeared to accept without scrutiny this lie which he invented for himself and believes in, and tried to regard him literally as a two-fold being and a Steppenwolf, and so designated him, it was merely in the hope of becoming more easily understood with the assistance of a delusion, which we must now endeavor to put in its true light. (pgs 56-57)

The dual nature of the Steppenwolf is a simplifying abstraction that people use to try and understand how they operate. In reality, the dual nature does not exist, and the reality seems to be far more complicated than what we can understand, so we grasp for this mental model because it is traditionally deemed as "good enough."

The text continues to explain that if HH were to deeply introspect a single moment in his life, he would have difficulty attributing its characteristics to either the wolf or the man, the issue being that there exists no clean division within his existence between wolf and man. In the traditional werewolf mythology, at any point the werewolf is either wolf or man with no overlap. Here though the situation is much more complex. In reality though, Harry, and indeed all humans, are possibly much more complicated than this.

> For there is not a single human being... who is so conveniently simple that his being can be explained as the sum of two or three principal elements... Harry consists of a hundred or a thousand selves, not of two. (pg. 57)

This dramatically complicates reality, so in order to try and maintain order, society perpetuates world views in which humans are seen as one unified soul. The text seems to suggest that this artificially unified nature is a hallmark of the bourgeois.

Hesse gives an example of a judge trying an accused murderer and contemplating the complicated reality of the human existence. Both the judge and the murderer hold many roles and have a complicated mosaic of selves within them, and many of these complications have the potential to overlap. Thus, the actions of the murderer could have just as easily been the actions of the judge. However, the judge must unify his personality within the artificial role of being "the judge" and do his duty by sentencing the murderer to death.

This all feels very similar to the notion of "roles" in sociology. Each person, depending on their setting, will operate by a different "ruleset" based on their role. This could include different interpretations of meaning, tone and mood, and possible actions that they may take. For example, a lawyer in a courtroom will interpret inputs and deliver outputs in a significantly different manner than if they were at home playing with their children. In one situation, the person unifies themselves behind the artificial role of being a "lawyer" whereas in the other they unify themselves behind the artificial role of being a "parent playing with their kids". Here I use the term artificial because the role and expected behavior of a lawyer is in general constructed by society whereas the role of a "parent playing with their kids" is an artificial amalgamation of society's "expectations on a parent playing with their kids" and that parent's personal views and beliefs on the matter. Furthermore, there are actions that the lawyer role must take which the parent role may not, and notions such as this open the door to wild contradictions within the "self".

Hesse continues to state that the mark of a genius is someone who breaks this illusion and embraces the divisions of the self. But society views this as taboo and is quick to deliver diagnoses such as schiziomania or bi-polar disorder in order to continue to cultivate the illusion of the unified soul.

> As a body everyone is single, as a soul never. (pg. 59)

But what is this unified soul illusion that is being forced upon us?

> These conceptions are not native to us, but are merely picked up at second hand, and it is in them, with their common source in the visible body, that the origin of the fiction of an ego, an individual, is really to be found. (pg. 59)

So it is the ego that is to blame, and to transcend into a genius, or "immortal" as Hesse occasionally refers to them as, one must abandon the notion of the ego. Now the ties between this novel and eastern philosophy are beginning to become more apparent.

### Conclusion

We started by asking the question "who or what is the Steppenwolf?" and ended up speculating about the nature of the human soul, world views which society enforces, and what separates "geniuses" from the rest of humanity. And we are barely a quarter of the way through the novel! The challenging nature of this take has caused it to be a slow read for me, but I am excited to continue on and see where this novel takes us.
