# Welcome

Within this site I publish a variety of thoughts. As you can see, my interests are varied but tend to cluster around math, programming, literature, and nature. The original intention of this repository is to digitally back up my thoughts and observations so that they may not be lost and can be easily referred to in the future. I hope you enjoy reading through the content.

## Programming & Analytics

My day job focuses chiefly on geospatial data analysis with an emphasis on brick-and-mortar franchise rollouts but I also service several direct-to-consumer eTail brands, orthodontist, private equity M&A/diligence work, advertising platforms, and more.

Another major portion of my job is programming as I develop and maintain much of the infrastructure that drives our company's models. I frequently dive into minor side hobby projects, and also expect some posts on this site to be regarding my side projects, but my github page (linked on the bottom left side of this page) would be the best place to reference my side projects.

At one point, I expected many posts on this blog to fall under under this category, but after a few months it became clear that I was less interested in writing about these topics and more interested in the topics of literature, philosophy, and religion.

## Literature

I love to read. Some of my earliest memories in life involve reading and it is one of the earliest forms of recreation that I have enjoyed. From a young age, my parents instilled into me an appreciation for fantasy, science fiction, and novels from the romantic period. After a few months of writing on this blog, it became apparent that literature was the dominant theme of my content and, so far, most articles fall under this category.

## Philosophy

My relationship with philosophy in the past is best described as tumultuous. Although as a mathematician and programmer I *thoroughly* enjoy abstract thought, in college I had difficulties with many of my philosophy professors, and while debating with friends regarding philosophy, I frequently decried what I felt was an intentional move on the part of philosophers to obfuscate their writings with rosy descriptions and vague analogies. The young Marxist in me repeated an anti-philosopher stump speech that went along the lines of, "if you feel what you have to say is important, then make it accessible to the common man." Nowadays I understand that this assessment, although perhaps fair for some philosophers, is unfair to lay across the entire field of philosophy. Just as mathematics was limited by natural language descriptions before the emergence of standard notation in the late Renaissance, philosophers face the challenge of expressing meaning and concepts which often times defy linguistic expression and are not easily formalized. Therefore, in my late 20s I decided to pursue the study of philosophy.

## Religious Studies

Reality *fascinates* me. What is it? If I had one do-over in college, I likely would have pursued theoretical physics, but it almost certainly would have cost my entire future social life. There are a lot of unresolved questions regarding reality, and most people, quite understandably, completely ignore them. Religion represents some of humanity's earliest efforts to answer these questions. Not only that, but it also attempts to help humans come to peace with their place in the world as well as gives them essential blueprints for self improvement and community building. Throughout my life, I have devoted a lot of time and attended many courses studying Christian texts, particularly from an evangelical perspective. However, I feel that it is time to begin studying and evaluating the texts from other religions as well.
