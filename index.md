# Welcome

Within this site I publish a variety of thoughts. As you can see, my interests are varied but tend to cluster around math, programming, literature, and nature. The original intention of this repository is to digitally back up my thoughts and observations so that they may not be lost and can be easily referred to in the future. I hope you enjoy reading through the content.

## Analytics

My day job focuses chiefly on geospatial data analysis with an emphasis on brick-and-mortar franchise rollouts but I also service several direct-to-consumer eTail brands, orthodontist, private equity M&A/diligence work, advertising platforms, and more. As such, I expect that many articles on this site will fall under the Analytics category, but probably not too many because I like a bit of variety and analytics is most of what I spend my time doing.

## Programming

Another major portion of my job is programming as I develop and maintain much of the infrastructure that drives our company's models. I frequently dive into minor side hobby projects, and also expect some posts on this site to be regarding my side projects, but my github page (linked on the bottom left side of this page) would be the best place to reference my side projects. Similar to the analytics, I expect many posts to fall under this category but not too many.

## Literature

I love to read. I do not read as much as I used to but I have decided to use this platform to host new entries in my book journal and make them globally accessible.

## Freelance Work

If you are interested in sourcing freelance data analysis or programming, please feel free to reach out to the email found on the side bar.
