## Professional Career

I specialize in data analysis particularly pertaining to market rollout strategy. I develop our scaled products and fulfill and maintain many custom projects. Most of my experience is in the franchise, medical, and shelter spaces.

Another major component of my job involves developing and maintain our company's python infrastructure which includes ETL pipelines, machine learning models, an SDK with our webapp's API, and our Prefect task scheduler for automating and abstracting large chunks of our workflows. I also maintain our Postgres database.

## Personal Life
I live with my wife and housepets in Klamath Falls, Oregon. My hobbies include solving puzzles, programming, reading, jogging, gardening, playing with the dog, camping, hiking, travelling, and backpacking.
